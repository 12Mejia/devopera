We&#39;ve been quiet lately, mostly working on internal QA for upcoming features and rewrites. But with 11.60 coming we need a browser.js for it and we have a couple of small patches for you as well. Enjoy.<br/><br/><span style="font-size: 140%">Added patches</span><br/>PATCH-533, Add jQuery to Amazon At A Glance page. Just another small piece of the puzzle.<br/><br/>PATCH-532, GDocs: avoid jumping to top when scrolling document list. Actually a regression in Ragnar√∂k, updating ARIA attributes on elements can reset the scroll position. This made it impossible to scroll do the bottom of a long document list in Google Docs with the new layout.<br/><br/>PATCH-529, Fix SiteCatalyst H.9 code on Nissan/Infiniti USA. They use a very old SiteCatalyst version that has known document.write problems.
