<p>I am about to embark on somewhat of a mission. Of education. In March I am visiting a number of universities to give talks on HTML5 and CSS3, along with slotting SXSWi somewhere in the middle of it all to talk about cross-device accessibility and web standards education (and maybe have a beer or two).</p>

<p>The university tour looks like so:</p>

<ul>
  <li>March 5th: Manchester Metropolitan University, UK. 13:00-14:00 in Geoffrey Manton building, room 201.</li>
  <li>March 9th: Art Institute of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. 17.15-18.15 reception followed by talks 18.30-20.30.</li>
  <li>March 10th: University of Texas in Austin, USA. Talks 19.30-20.30 in Welch Hall (Room 2.304). Cookies included.</li>
  <li>March 12th-16th: Break for SXSWi!</li>
  <li>March 17th: Texas State Technical College, Waco, Texas, USA. Contact College for more details.
  <li>March 19th: University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, USA. My talk here is part of the <a href="http://devchatt.org/">DevChatt</a> event. **UPDATE** Location and time to be announced; details currently in flux!</li>
  <li>March 23rd: University of Georgia, Atlanta, USA. Talk at 6pm. Contact university for more details.</li>
</li></ul>

</ul>

<p>I will also be promoting my new book along the way — <a href="http://interactwithwebstandards.com/">InterAct with Web Standards: A Holistic Approach to Web Design</a> — coauthored along with a number of my friends and colleagues in the WaSP Edu Task Force. With this book we are aiming to provide the ultimate teaching/learning guide for web design basics, and discuss the bigger picture — so many books just yarn on about HTML and/or CSS in isolation, but we also cover using the Web to learn more effectively, information architecture, accessibility, and more. Check it out asap!</p>
