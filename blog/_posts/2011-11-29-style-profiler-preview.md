<p>CSS selector matching is often neglected when it comes to performance of web documents and applications. For small documents, the performance impact is negligible, but for documents with a large DOM (like the Opera Dragonfly application itself), a single &quot;bad&quot; selector can have a serious impact.

<p>CSS selector matching refers to the process where a browser tries to match a selector against an element in the DOM. In terms of performance, some selectors are better than others. For instance, an ID selector is better than the universal selector (<code>*</code>), because the former only matches one element (and is cached). Matching elements in a big DOM against many unspecific selectors might cause your page to render significantly slower because of the number of elements affected.

<p>We <a href="http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2011/11/08/small-update-in-11-60" target="_blank">recently introduced support for style profiling in Core</a>, and this is the first preview of its implementation in Opera Dragonfly.

<p>Opera takes several actions from the time it loads a document to when it is rendered on screen: markup, stylesheets and scripts are parsed, scripts are executed, parts of the page are painted on screen. All of these events that occur while rendering are presented in a timeline in this profiler. Our focus has been on providing detailed information about CSS selectors. Clicking the &quot;Style recalculation&quot; header, or one of the individual style recalculation events in the timeline, will give you a list of the most expensive selectors.

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is a special build of Opera Dragonfly â€“ the functionality has not yet been merged with either the experimental or cutting-edge builds. Only the Profiler tab is available. To test, grab a recent Opera build (11.60 or 12) from the <a href="http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/" target="_blank">Desktop team blog</a>, and set the <a href="opera:config#DeveloperTools">Developer Tools URL</a> to:</p>
<pre><code><a>https://dragonfly.opera.com/app/profiler/</a></code></pre>
<p>Keep in my mind that this is an early preview. Lots of things will be tweaked before this is released.</p></div>

<p>As a real-world example of how big the impact can be on performance, I made a test with the full <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/" target="_blank">HTML5 specification</a> downloaded locally and ran the profiler. I noticed a few of the most expensive selectors had &quot;:link&quot; and &quot;:visited&quot;. I changed these to instead be &quot;a:link&quot; or &quot;a:visited&quot; (in this case they were equivalent in terms of which elements matched). This trivial change makes the engine use a cache, and brought the selector matching time down from about 14 seconds to about 11 seconds.

<p>Apart from detailed selector matching performance, you can hover on events in the timeline to get more information about them. For example, when you hover on a paint event, it will show the point in the viewport where the paint event occurred, and how big the painted area was.

<p>This is only the first part of a Dragonfly profiler. A JavaScript profiler is on the roadmap, so keep your eyes open.</p>
