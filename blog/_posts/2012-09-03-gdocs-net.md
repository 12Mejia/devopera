## Added patches

- PATCH-842, gsmtronix.com: HVmenu.
- PATCH-835, Generic fix for the .Net JS library that defines a broken PopOut_Position() function for Opera.
- PATCH-513, office.microsoft.com: re-initialize video player after applying page overflow.

## Changed patches

PATCH-382, Google Spreadsheets cell size and column label size mismatch. New version seems more reliable, but may also break stuff. The patch works around the maze of browser sniffers. Known issues: Ctrl C or V still fails in 12.0x (but works in 12.50), while arrow navigation still fails in 12.50 (but works in 12.0x)

## Removed patches

- PATCH-810, Emulating IEâ€™s `cssText` property on style sheets for Skydrive. Fixed by site.
- PATCH-730, Menu misplaced on treasury.gov due to window.opera sniffing in .NET JS library. Replaced by generic PATCH-835.
- PATCH-699, engfilms.ru: needs navigator.product to work. Dead site.
- PATCH-480, IME input invisible and does not trigger Google Suggest due to missing events. Fixed by site.
