<p>We’ve pushed out a minor update to the <a href="http://my.opera.com/dragonfly/blog/getting-opera-dragonfly-ready-for-opera-11/#enable">experimental</a> version of Opera Dragonfly. The main changes are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Updated syntax highlighting to distinguish between HTML/XML, CSS and JavaScript</li>
    <li>Ability to add new rules in the Style Inspector (initial implementation)</li>
    <li>Badge displaying the error count in the Error Log button (Opera Dragonfly must be open before loading the page to see this). A similar badge is show in the JavaScript Debugger button to show when execution is paused.</li>
    <li>Updated scroll behaviour in the Scripts source view</li>
    <li>Visual differentiation to show that the browser default styles in the Style Inspector can not be edited</li>
    <li>Edit: Inline and Evaled scripts now show a code snippet in the script drop down</li>
</ul>

<p>We’d love to hear your feedback. There may be various merge conflicts, such as the comments and doctype in the DOM Inspector not receiving their correct greyed out style.</p>
