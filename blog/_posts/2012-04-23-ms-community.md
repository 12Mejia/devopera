## Added patches

PATCH-619, Emulating IE breaks Microsoft fora. As discussed [here][1] it recently became impossible to post new comments on social.microsoft.com with Opera after they upgraded their software. Until IE9, `document.getSelection()` would return a string, while `window.getSelection()` would return a selection object. For compatibility Opera implemented the same behavior. Fast forward to now, the upgraded MS community site depends on the new spec compliant behavior where both methods return a selection object.

Incidentally, just before Easter we completed a rewrite of Prestoâ€™s Range and Selection [implementation][2] that also fixes this. But until that reaches public builds Hallvord wrote a one-liner to fix this site.

	document.getSelection=function(){return window.getSelection();}

- PATCH-617, missing QuickView background color on Forever21.co.jp. Missing styles.
- PATCH-88, Make links work on Aeonretail. Outdated jQuery plugin detects Opera and scrolls up.
