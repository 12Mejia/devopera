intro: 'In this article, we have the pleasure of introducing you to Raphaël, a JavaScript API for SVG that not only allows you to write SVG functionality using JavaScript code, but also provides support for SVG in IE, by emulating it in VML. This is a great tool for introducing more people to the power of SVG, and we’d like to wish it every success.'
