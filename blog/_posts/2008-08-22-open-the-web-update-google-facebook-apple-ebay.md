<p>A number of high profile sites have been fixed or are in the process of being fixed this week and last.    Many users noticed that <a href="http://www.orkut.com/">Orkut</a> broke in Opera Mini.  We were snowed under with bug reports on this issue.  The issue was with a malformed <code>meta</code> refresh that was sent to Opera Mini.  We’ve been in touch with the Orkut team and they’ve kindly fixed the issue.  Orkut especially has many Opera Mini users, as we both share two markets that we are both very strong in–Brazil and India.  All those users can get back to having a mobile social life now.</p><p>On the subject of Google, Google Docs removed the block on Opera a while ago, but the Spreadsheets and Presentation components still blocked Opera at the door.  We’ve been talking to the Spreadsheets team, and that block should be removed shortly.  Now we just need to get Google Presentations working and the suite will fully support Opera.</p>

<p>Next up, <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple.com</a> had a number of issues with embedding videos in their pages with Opera.  These have now been fixed.  One site that has caused Opera headaches for a long time is <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a>.  We had both spoofs and browser.js patches for this site.  We’ve been in touch with eBay for a while now, and we just got informed now that they’ve been working on fixes and eBay now supports Opera.  Big thanks for the people at eBay that worked to make sure that long standing Opera issues were fixed.</p><p>  Finally, the last major site I want to highlight is the new <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>.  When releasing the new version, there was issues in Facebook.JS that caused Opera to not work with the friends list.  We’ve been in touch with Facebook and they fixed the issue this week.</p>

<p>With Google Docs compatibility issues slowing winding down, one of the main issues we’d like to fix in the Open the Web team is the compatibility with Yahoo! Mail.  This is one of our main blockers, and while Yahoo! in general are very responsive to fixing issue, Yahoo! Mail has always remained allusive. Another issue with Yahoo! is <a href="http://in.maps.yahoo.com/system_requirements">Yahoo! Maps India</a>, which in their own words from the blocking page <q>sucks</q>.  I’m not sure if this version of Maps is used in different territories as, taking a random sampling of UK, USA, Germany and Brazil, all of their Maps sites work in Opera.</p>
