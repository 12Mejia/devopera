<p>So I was there at <a href="http://jsfoo.hasgeek.com/" target="_blank">jsFoo</a> in Bangalore last weekend, which I think was India&#39;s first exclusively JS based conference. The event was great, with a turnout which was greater than expected. We had talked on the some advanced JS tricks, stuff on the internal working of some JS engines, a few node.js talks, as well as my talk which was about how does JS fit into the mobile web.</p>

<p>The following are my slides:</p>

<div style="width:425px" id="__ss_9553313"><strong style="display:block;margin:12px 0 4px"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/shwetank/building-great-mobile-apps-somethings-you-might-want-to-know" title="Building great mobile apps: Somethings you might want to know">Building great mobile apps: Somethings you might want to know</a></strong><object id="__sse9553313" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=jsfoo-111005033641-phpapp02&amp;stripped_title=building-great-mobile-apps-somethings-you-might-want-to-know&amp;userName=shwetank" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="never" /><embed name="__sse9553313" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=jsfoo-111005033641-phpapp02&amp;stripped_title=building-great-mobile-apps-somethings-you-might-want-to-know&amp;userName=shwetank" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355" allowscriptaccess="never" /></object><div style="padding:5px 0 12px">View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">presentations</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/shwetank">shwetank</a>.</div></div>


<p>One of the things I noticed was that, people knew about AppCache, but no about the events associated with them. So I tried highlighting them. I also noticed people asking the presenters who came before me about offline storage and how to sync it back to the server, so I provided an example of how to do it in case of a web form using localStorage. In the end, I also talked about device orientation and <code>getUserMedia</code>. I&#39;ve linked some usefull resources to check out in the slides themselves, but I&#39;ll mention some here for the lazy ;)</p>
