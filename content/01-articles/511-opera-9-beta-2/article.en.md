<p>
We released the second – and final – beta of Opera 9 today. This will be the last major milestone release before the final launch of Opera 9. The most notable change is to the widget UI. You&#39;ll notice that we&#39;ve included widgets separately in the menu bar. If you click to manage widgets, your widgets open in a separate tab, similar to our transfer manager. From this tab, you can add new widgets, open downloaded widgets and remove widgets you don&#39;t want.
