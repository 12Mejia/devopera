<p>I&#39;ve been enjoying <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/06/devicepixelrati.html"><abbr title="Peter-Paul Koch">PPK</abbr>&#39;s recent look at <cite>devicePixelRatio</cite></a> and <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/07/more_about_devi.html"><cite>More about devicePixelRatio</cite></a>, but one detail in the latter post caught my eye: discussing the <code>devicePixelRatio</code> on the Galaxy Nexus, he notes that Opera Mobile goes for a ratio of <code>2.25</code>, while other browser use a ratio of <code>2</code>.</p>
<p>By default, the <code>devicePixelRatio</code> in Opera Mobile is determined by the device&#39;s reported resolution:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Resolution</th><th><code>devicePixelRatio</code></th><th></th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>&lt; 170dpi</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>170-200dpi</td><td>1.25</td></tr>
<tr><td>200-260dpi</td><td>1.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>260-280dpi</td><td>1.75</td></tr>
<tr><td>280-320dpi</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>&gt; 320dpi</td><td>2.25</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now, the Galaxy Nexus has a nominal resolution of 316dpi, so it should actually end up with a <code>devicePixelRatio</code> of <code>2</code>...but perhaps the OS is reporting it as 320dpi, triggering the slightly higher ratio.</p>

<p>One aspect that seems to be unique to Opera Mobile, however, is that users can change the <code>devicePixelRatio</code> through the <em>Zoom</em> preference in the browser&#39;s <em>Settings</em>.</p>
<p>On regular (non-mobile-optimised) sites, this setting affects how closely the browser zooms into the page when double-tapping. At the same time, though, changing this setting also changes the <code>devicePixelRatio</code>, to make this preference more effective on mobile-optimised sites. For instance, setting the preference to 175% globally sets the <code>devicePixelRatio</code> to 1.75. This will obviously have an effect on sites that use viewport <code>meta</code> to set things like <code>width=device-width</code> and sites that use pixel-ratio-specific Media Queries, as the reported values will now be different.</p>
<p>Note that this global <em>Zoom</em> setting is different from a user&#39;s normal zoom/pinch-zoom action â€“ in those situations, <code>devicePixelRatio</code> doesn&#39;t change.</p>
