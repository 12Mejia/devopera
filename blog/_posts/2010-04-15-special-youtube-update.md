Following yesterday&#39;s update of Youtube, Opera 10.5x users were left with a Flash upgrade message. We&#39;re doing this quick and dirty urgent patch to make it work again for now.

## UPDATE:



Youtube has fixed this issue, so patch is no longer needed

## /UPDATE

## Added patches

PATCH-234 <a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube</a> Flash detection fails due to bug in Carakan plug-in scripting. This patch effectively disables the Flash upgrade functionality on Youtube, so we hope it will be short lived.

PATCH-222 <a href="http://mail.qq.com" target="_blank">qq.com</a> mail sending hangs when trying to read iframe attributes

PATCH-220 <a href="http://www.fujifilm.ch/" target="_blank">fujifilm.ch</a> Working around a bug that hides menu entries

## Disabled patches
