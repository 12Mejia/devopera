<p>At Opera, we&#39;ve been using GitHub for quite a while for a number of projects, including but not limited to <a href="https://github.com/operasoftware/operadriver/">OperaDriver</a>, <a href="https://github.com/operasoftware/shinydemos">Shiny Demos</a>, <a href="http://operasoftware.github.com/">RoboHydra</a>, <a href="https://github.com/operasoftware/Emberwind">Emberwind</a>, <a href="https://github.com/operasoftware/browserjs">Browser JS</a> and since last week, also the <a href="https://github.com/operasoftware/dragonfly">Opera Dragonfly</a> project.</p>

<p>That is all very exciting of course, but looking at the <a href="https://github.com/operasoftware">Opera Software GitHub page</a>, it&#39;s easy to get lost in the multitude of repos. So, I decided to dive in and create some order out of the chaos. The result is <strong><a href="http://operasoftware.github.com/">operasoftware.github.com</a></strong>, which aims to be a friendly entry point into what Opera has to offer on GitHub.</p>

<p>Happy forking!</p>
