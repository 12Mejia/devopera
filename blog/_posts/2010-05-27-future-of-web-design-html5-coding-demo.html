<p>I was privileged to be invited to speak at <a href="http://futureofwebdesign.com/">Future of Web Design</a> last week. I gave a live coding demo rather than slides, so view the source of the (intentionally-ugly) page I built over the 40 minutes.

<p>Thanks to all who attended, and all who visited the Opera booth. I chatted so hard, I lost my voice the day after the conference! I&#39;d also like to thank Cat Clark from Carsonified who did a superb job of organising her first event.</p></p>
