Opera 23 (based on Chromium 36) for [Mac and Windows](http://www.opera.com/computer) is out! Here’s what that means for web developers.

## CSS `touch-action`

[The `touch-action` CSS property](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/pointerevents/raw-file/tip/pointerEvents.html#the-touch-action-css-property) is part of the Pointer Events specification. Its value determines whether touch input may trigger default browser behavior such as zooming or panning. For example, to disable all default touch behaviors on a particular element, you can now use:

	.foo {
		touch-action: none;
	}

## CSS `will-change`

[The `will-change` CSS property](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-will-change/#will-change) can be used to signal that a particular CSS property’s value, or an element’s content, is likely to change, so that the browser can optimize for these changes ahead of time. See [Sara Soueidan’s article on `will-change`](http://dev.opera.com/articles/css-will-change-property/) for more information.

## Unprefixed CSS Transforms

Opera previously supported the `-webkit`-prefixed versions of the `transform`, `transform-style`, `perspective`, `perspective-origin`, and `backface-visibility` CSS properties. We now support [the standardized and unprefixed names for these](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-transforms/).

## `element.animate()`

[The Web Animations specification](http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/web-animations/) introduces a model that explains the execution of CSS Animations, CSS Transitions, and SVG Animations, and exposes a JavaScript API to give scripts similar capabilities. Opera and Chrome now support [the `element.animate()` method](http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/web-animations/#extensions-to-the-element-interface) as defined by this standard. Here’s a simple example:

	// Animate the background of the <body> element
	// from white to black in 2 seconds.
	document.body.animate(
		[
			{ 'background': 'white' },
			{ 'background': 'black' }
		],
		2000
	);

For more, check out [the `element.animate()` demo]({{ page.id }}/web-animations.html) and its source code.

Support for the rest of the Web Animations API will be added in future releases.

## Observing JavaScript objects `Object.observe()`

[`Object.observe()`](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:observe) makes it possible to easily observe changes to a given JavaScript object. Here’s a basic example:

	var object = {};
	// Start observing changes to the object.
	Object.observe(object, function(changes) {
		changes.forEach(function(change, index) {
			console.log(change.name, change.type, change.object[change.name]);
		});
	});
	// Make some changes to the object.
	object.first = 'John';
	object.last = 'Smith';
	delete object.first;

This functionality enables performant data binding implementations, which is good news for [MVC libraries](http://todomvc.com/).

To cancel observation, `Object.unobserve(object, callback)` can be used. When dealing with arrays instead of objects, it’s easier to stick to `Array.observe(array, callback)` and `Array.unobserve(array, callback)`. There’s `Object.deliverChangeRecords(callback)` and `Object.getNotifier(object)`, too. See [the `Object.observe` tutorial on HTML5 Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es7/observe/) for more info.

## HTML Imports

HTML Imports are a way to include and reuse HTML documents in other HTML documents. This feature falls under the [Web Components](http://webcomponents.org/) umbrella. To learn more about HTML Imports, check out [the tutorial on HTML5 Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/imports/).

## What’s next?

If you’re interested in experimenting with features that are in the pipeline for future versions of Opera, we recommend following [our Opera Developer stream](http://www.opera.com/developer).
