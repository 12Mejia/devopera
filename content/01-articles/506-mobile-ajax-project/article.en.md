Would you like to get personalized and always updated newsfeed directly on the idle-screen of your mobile phone? How about location based traffic information or a map service similar to Google Maps? This is what Opera, Telenor and FAST set out to test in a R&amp;D study named Aida earlier this year. The solution was tested on a large number of end users over many months and was very well received among the testers. Follow the link below and check out the video from the solution running live on a Windows Mobile phone.
