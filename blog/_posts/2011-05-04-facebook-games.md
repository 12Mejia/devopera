## Removed patches

PATCH-264, Enable @mentions. Updates from Facebook made this obsolete. At the same time the presence of the patch caused games like Farmville and Mafiawars to fail loading, so better remove it ASAP.

233838, National Map Viewer on USGS relies on Netscape detection for functionality. Old version of maps retired in favor of a new more compatible map.
