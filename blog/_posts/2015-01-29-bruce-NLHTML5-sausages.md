I was invited to give a talk to the inaugural NLHTML5 meet-up in Amsterdam about how web standards have been made in the past, and how that will change in the future. [Slides are available](https://brucelawson.github.io/talks/2015/NLHTML5/) and here's a YouTube video made by the organisers. (As this was written for an evening meet-up in Amsterdam, there may be language in it that's isn't appropriate for your workplace.)
