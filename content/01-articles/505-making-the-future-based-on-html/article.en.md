The W3C recently renewed its HTML activity. Opera joined the new
<a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/">
 HTML Working Group
</a>
to help shape the future of the web and so
      can you. The HTML Working Group allows virtually everyone to
      participate. A set of simple steps on how to join is outlined on
      the WHATWG blog:
<a href="http://blog.whatwg.org/w3c-restarts-html-effort">
 W3C restarts HTML effort
</a>
. If you have any
      questions or want to discuss HTML with members of the Working
      Group you can join the public IRC channel
<a href="irc://irc.w3.org:6665/html-wg">
 #html-wg
</a>
on
      irc.w3.org (port 80 or 6665).
 
      As a starting point for the new Working Group Opera, together
      with Mozilla and Apple,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/mid/29BA08F9-96C7-44BC-BE23-9E163E5D8DEA@apple.com">
 submitted
</a>
the WHATWG HTML5 proposal as
      initial input to base future work on. We hope that it proves to
      be a good starting point for the future of HTML.
