<p>There are many reasons why it is important to test your web sites in Opera.  I’m just going to focus on one here–the mobile market.  The mobile web has been getting a lot more press recently, and it is a market where Opera is in a very strong position, and is moving from strength to strength.  It the last quarter we announced that Opera Mini alone had over 15.8 million unique users in the month of July, up from 3.5 million in July 2007.  It grew from 850 million web pages viewed to 3.7 <em>billion</em>, a year on year growth of 330%.  This generated 44.5 terabytes of compressed traffic, or 296.6 terabytes if the data wasn&#39;t compressed by the Opera Mini servers.  This growth is only going to get fuelled as Opera signs more deals with operators for pre-installing Opera Mini.  Away from Opera Mini, the first beta of Opera Mobile 9.5 came out recently, and it is already being shipped pre-installed on some popular high end phones.</p>

<h3>Operators shipping Opera Mini pre-installed</h3>

The following operators are shipping Opera Mini by default on their range of phones.  We usually find that traffic and unique users go up quite a bit after we are pre-installed on operators phones.  For web developers, Opera Mini being pre-installed means that you can almost guarantee that Opera Mini will be available, and it becomes much more important to support Opera on your site if a major operator in your target markets ship with Opera Mini on their phones.  Some operators re-badge Opera Mini to their own branding and some keep it as Opera Mini.  The browser will always report it is Opera Mini of you detect the User Agent however.
