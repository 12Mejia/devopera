## Added patches

PATCH-468, Make sure Play menu doesn’t wrap.

They use font sizes in pt and then calculate element widths with something like `width:7.549em` Opera doesn’t use sufficient precision when storing such values, causing rounding errors, making the main menu too wide.

## Removed patches

- PATCH-341, Meebo tries to use `detachEvent` to remove listeners added with `addEventListener`. Site changed.
- PATCH-272 Remove non-functional `addEventListener` from XHR objects. Core fix.
- PATCH-250, Allow play.com searching with Enter. Site changed.
- 244416, NRG.co.il saving articles does not work. Site changed.
