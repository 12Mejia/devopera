Twenty years ago, Tim Berners-Lee founded the [World Wide Web Consortium](http://www.w3.org/) (W3C), an international community that develops open standards. It's thanks to these standards and the openness and compatibility that they encompass that we can browse and view the same web pages in, say, Firefox on desktop, Chrome on a Chromebook, Internet Explorer on Windows Phone, Opera on Android and many other current and future browser-and-device combinations.

To mark this anniversary, the W3C invites the web community to a <del>cray cray bday bash</del> [3-hour symposium on the future of the web](http://www.w3.org/20/) on October 29 2014: topics to be discussed include how we can make the web more beautiful; how we can bring it to more devices; how we can ensure its security and the privacy of communications happening through the network; and how it can empower all to use and build on the web, regardless of language or ability.

If you want to attend, you can [register online](http://www.w3.org/20/). And for those who can't make it, there will be a livestream as well.
