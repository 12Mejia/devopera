Dmitry has over a decade of experience in creating web applications. Having started as a back end developer, he later changed his orientation to front end development and even pure design. These days he spends his working hours trying to embrace a wide range of front end technologies while working as a Senior Computer Scientist at [Adobe](http://adobe.com).
He is also the creator of [Optimus](http://microformatique.com/optimus/), the Microformats transformer, as well as a [RaphaÃ«l](http://raphaeljs.com), JavaScript library for vector graphics. More recently, he was involved in developing [Snap.svg](http://snapsvg.io). At any given moment he is always working on three secret projects, though no one knows where he gets the time for any of this.
