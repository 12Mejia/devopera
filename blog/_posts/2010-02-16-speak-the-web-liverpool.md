<p>Spent a delightful evening at the <a href="http://www.thisisleaf.co.uk/">Leaf Tea Shop &amp; Bar</a> in Liverpool last night as part of the <a href="http://speaktheweb.org/">Speak the Web</a> series of &quot;gig&quot; style events.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was nice and relaxed, with a little bit of banter provided by the speakers and the likes of <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Andy Clarke</a> heckling from the front row. <a href="http://www.systemerror.co.uk/">Jake Smith</a> gave a good overview of typography and the web – with a bit of an 8-bit feel thrown in for good measure (I&#39;m sure Jake would appreciate the collection of retro pixel fonts I made ages ago, listed on our <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/font-face-web-fonts-resources"><cite>@font-face Web Fonts resources</cite></a> post) – and <a href="http://colly.com/">Simon Collison</a> took us on a whirlwind tour of modernism, post-modernism, semiotics and his memories of art school to provide an insight into his practice as a web designer.</p>
<p>For my own part, I gave an overview of some of the cool new things in HTML5. As ever, I overran &quot;slightly&quot;, but our gracious organisers – hat tip to <a href="http://richclarkdesign.com/">Rich Clark</a> and <a href="http://hereinthehive.com/">Dan Donald</a> – were kind enough to indulge me...I can only justify it by saying that there&#39;s so much interesting stuff and potential in the new standard that I simply had to convey my enthusiasm for it to the audience.</p>
<p>Here is my presentation, available on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/redux/speak-the-web-15022010">Slideshare</a>.</p>

<p>And the various demonstrations I ran through:</p>
