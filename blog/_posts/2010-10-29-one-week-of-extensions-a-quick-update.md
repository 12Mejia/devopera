<p>It&#39;s only been one week since our initial <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/introduction-to-opera-extensions">Labs release of Opera 11 alpha</a> – which comes with support for extensions – and we&#39;re very happy to see that it has generated enormous developer interest, with our <a href="https://addons.labs.opera.com/">Opera extensions catalog</a> steadily growing in size and many more extension submission in the pipeline.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve received quite a bit of feedback about our current extension approval process – rest assured that we&#39;re working on making the whole experience of submitting extensions less opaque, so that developers can submit questions to the moderators and get a clear overview of where their extension is in the approval queue. We&#39;re also working on speeding up the overall approval process, but this will take a little more time, so bear with us!</p>
<p>Developers have also asked us about the choice of licenses we provide as part of the submission process. At present, you can choose between the <a href="https://addons.labs.opera.com/developer/license/hosting/">Opera hosting license</a> and the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache 2.0 license</a> for your extension, but there seems to be a strong interest in having <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GPL</a> as an option as well. We&#39;re looking into it and hope to be able to let developers know soon.</p>
<p>As for documentation, be sure to check out Shwetank&#39;s latest <a href="https://dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-extensions-messaging/">Dev.Opera article on messaging in Opera extensions</a> and Daniel&#39;s <a href="https://dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-extension-code-examples/">Opera extension code examples</a> article. We&#39;re working on more stuff to be published in the next couple of days and weeks, so stay tuned!</p>
