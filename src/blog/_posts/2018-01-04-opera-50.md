Opera 50 (based on Chromium 63) for [Mac, Windows, Linux](https://www.opera.com/computer) is out! To
find out what’s new for users, see our
[Desktop blog post](https://blogs.opera.com/desktop/2018/01/opera-50-introduces-anti-bitcoin-mining-tool).
Here’s what it means for web developers.


## Dynamic module imports

New JavaScript module import syntax allows developers to dynamically load code
into modules and scripts at runtime. This makes it possible to load parts of an
application lazily, which can be used to improve application start-up time or to
avoid loading seldom used parts until they are actually needed.

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', event => {
    import('./dialogBox.js')
    .then(dialogBox => {
        dialogBox.open();
    })
    .catch(error => {
        /* Error handling */
    });
});
```

The [code example](http://2ality.com/2017/01/import-operator.html#use-cases)
above shows how to use the import(specifier) function to import JavaScript after
an event.


## Async iterators and generators

Asynchronous iteration is made more convenient with the addition of asynchronous
generator functions

```javascript
async function* generateAsync() {
  while(condition) {
    const an_object = await produceAnObject();
    yield an_object.some_property;
  }
}
```

and the asynchronous iteration protocol

```javascript
for await (const item of generateAsync()) {
  console.log({ item });
}
```

Read more about this syntax and its possibilites on
[Jake Archibald's blog](https://jakearchibald.com/2017/async-iterators-and-generators/)
or in this
[summary of the "Asynchronous Iteration" proposal](http://2ality.com/2016/10/asynchronous-iteration.html).


## Device Memory API

Using the new
[Device Memory API](https://github.com/w3c/device-memory#the-web-exposed-api)
developers can estimate the total amount of RAM on the device. This information
could be used to deliver a suitably scaled version of the site to lower-end
devices, or help put collected performance data into context to better
understand the behavior of a web application.


## Other web platform features in this release

### Blink > CSS

* Developers can now
  [make pixel-level adjustments](http://w3c-test.org/html/semantics/embedded-content/the-img-element/sizes/parse-a-sizes-attribute.html)
  using the new
  [Q length unit](http://thenewcode.com/1158/The-Q-Continuum-Using-q-Measurements-In-CSS),
  which is especially useful on small viewports.

### Blink > Fonts

* [font-variant-east-asian](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-3/#font-variant-east-asian-prop)
  is now supported, allowing developers to control the
  [usage of alternate glyphs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variant-east-asian)
  for East Asian languages like Japanese and Chinese.

### Blink > HTML

* To improve interoperability, Opera will fire `beforeprint` and `afterprint`
  events as part of the printing standard, allowing developers to annotate the
  printed copy and edit the annotation after the printing command is done
  executing.

### Blink > JavaScript

* Using
  [`Promise.prototype.finally()`](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/10/promise-finally),
  a callback can now be registered to be invoked after a `Promise` has been
  either fulfilled or rejected.
* The
  [`Intl.PluralRules` API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/10/intl-pluralrules)
  allows developers to build applications that understand pluralization of a
  given language by indicating which plural form applies for a given number and
  language.

### Blink > MediaStream

* [`MediaStreamTrack.applyConstraints()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/applyConstraints)
  is now supported for local video
  [`MediaStreamTracks`](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#mediastreamtrack),
  including tracks obtained from
  [`getUserMedia()`](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia()),
  [capture from media elements](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-fromelement/)
  or screen capture.

### Blink > Network

* [Version 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18kQ_TFQns2HZ9KGs4bGDfiiOIRmOhI12oJBttvUlYLY/edit)
  of
  [NT LAN Manager (NTLM) API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc236621.aspx)
  is now shipped, enabling applications to authenticate remote users and provide
  session security when requested by the application.

### Blink > Storage

* The
  [localStorage and sessionStorage APIs](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webstorage.html#the-storage-interface)
  now use `getItem()` rather than an anonymous getter, so attempting to access a
  key using `getItem()` will now return `null` rather than `undefined`. Thanks
  to Intel for the contribution!
* To improve developer experience, the methods on
  [sessionStorage and localStorage](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webstorage.html#the-storage-interface)
  such as `getItem()`, `removeItem()`, and `clear()` are now enumerable. Thanks
  to Intel for making this happen!


## Deprecations and interoperability improvements

### Blink > Bindings

* To improve interoperability, a TypeError is now thrown by
  `EventTarget.addEventListener()` and `EventTarget.removeEventListener()` when
  the callback argument is not an `EventListener`, `null`, or `undefined`.
* Also to improve interoperability,
  [instance properties](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#dfn-attribute-getter)
  with a `Promise` type now return a rejected promise instead of throwing an
  exception when the property access fails.

### Blink > CSS

* The
  [`/deep/` or `>>>` selector](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping/#deep-combinator),
  as well as `::shadow`,
  [are now removed](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/10/remove-shadow-piercing)
  from CSS dynamic profile, following their
  [deprecation](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/68qSZM5QMRQ/pT2YCqZSomAJ)
  in Opera 32 / Chromium 45.

### Blink > DOM

* To improve interoperability,
  [`HTMLAllCollection`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-dom-interfaces.html),
  [`HTMLCollection`](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#htmlcollection),
  [`HTMLFormControlsCollection`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormControlsCollection)
  and
  [`HTMLOptionsCollection`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLOptionsCollection)
  are no longer enumerable, so they are now left out of calls to `Object.keys()`
  or `for-in` loops.
