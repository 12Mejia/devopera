<p>Yesterday, we released a major update to <a href="http://dev.opera.com">Dev.Opera</a>. The most obvious change is of course the visual refresh, but we&#39;ve also rewritten the whole back-end from scratch, so as to make it more flexible and robust.</p>
<p><a href="http://dev.opera.com/"><img src="/blog/a-new-dev-opera/devopera620.png" alt="new Dev.Opera" /></a></p>

<p>A quick tour around some of the bigger changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#39;ve simplified the categorization to just 5 sections, each with their own featured content: <a href="http://dev.opera.com/web">Web</a>, <a href="http://dev.opera.com/addons">Add-ons</a> (which has 4 parts), <a href="http://dev.opera.com/mobile">Mobile</a>, <a href="http://dev.opera.com/tv">TV</a> and <a href="http://dev.opera.com/labs">Labs</a>. Tags and search let you dive deeper into topics of interest, and you can use the new pagination feature to browse through everything we&#39;ve published.</li>
<li>The Opera Labs page, which was living outside of Dev.Opera before, will be discontinued in its current form, and it is now integrated as a <a href="http://dev.opera.com/labs">separate Dev.Opera section</a>. This makes sense, as Labs releases often go together with a technical article, so you have everything in one place.</li>
<li>Articles now have real comments: a real improvement over the previous system where comments were actually forum threads.</li>
<li>Color highlighting for code blocks to improve readability of code samples included in the articles.</li>
<li>Handy sidebar navigation for e.g. our <a href="http://dev.opera.com/addons/extensions/">Opera Extensions documentation</a>, so you keep a clear overview and don&#39;t get lost between articles.</li>
<li>A fresh, adaptive design, based on viewport and media query goodness. One Web <abbr title="for the win">FTW</abbr>!</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the next couple of days and weeks, we&#39;ll be ironing out some of the remaining bugs and further tweak the existing content — if you find any issues, let us know on <a href="http://twitter.com/odevrel/">@ODevRel</a>. If you want to <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/create">submit new articles</a>, you can do so as well of course!</p>

<p>And to celebrate the release, we&#39;ve published two new articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/love-your-devices-adaptive-web-design-with-media-queries-viewport-and-more">Love your devices: adaptive web design with media queries, viewport and more</a> by Chris Mills, in which he explains how to use a combination of those handy media queries, viewport, but also object-fit and the video media attribute to prepare your content for different screens.</li>
<li><a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/porting-3d-graphics-to-the-web-webgl-intro-part-2">Porting 3D graphics to the web — WebGL intro part 2</a> by Luz Caballero. In the second installment of her <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/tags/webgl">WebGL article series</a>, Luz explains how to convert 3D models created in graphical packages like SketchUp, Blender or Shade to WebGL for inclusion in your website.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, roll up those sleeves, and get coding!</p>
