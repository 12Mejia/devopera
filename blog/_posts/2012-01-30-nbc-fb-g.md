## Added patches

- PATCH-577, Unexpected script loading order breaks video player ready check on nbc.com. Core bug.
- PATCH-576, Avoid extra history entries with Facebook like button. Again they assume that `attachEvent` support means browser is IE. Affects _a lot_ of sites. Slightly risky so watch out for regressions.
- PATCH-574, nova.edu: work around browser sniffing.

- PATCH-526, G+: avoid tall narrow posts due to word-wrap in table. Apply new classname.
- 194334, Y!Mail remove `selectSingleNode` and `selectNodes`. To support old AT&T version.
- 331093, Work around Opera bug where second BR tag overwrites newly inserted IMG (ameba.jp, site changed)
