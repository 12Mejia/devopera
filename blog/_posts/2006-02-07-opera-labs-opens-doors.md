Welcome to Opera Labs, a behind-the-scenes look at the latest technology and products from Opera Software.

Everything you download here is a sneak preview, a look ahead to the future of browsing and a taste of what’s to come. Feel free to take a bite.

But that’s only part of our mission at Opera Labs. We at Opera believe in an open Web for everyone. We try hard to use open standards in everything we do. We hope Opera Labs, by providing active encouragement for standards, will play a vital role in shaping an open and shared future for the Web.
