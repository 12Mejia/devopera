A freezing start of the new year (-15°C in Oslo today) so the start is slow, only for 12.1x this time.

## Added patches

- PATCH-1099, YouTube comments: bad opacity animation performance in Presto caused high CPU and slow loading of “All comments”. Workaround is to skip the animation.
- PATCH-1097, razri.com: CSS `url()` argument takes quotes.

## Removed patches

PATCH-1080, hp.com — missing background gradient. Site updated, no longer uses offending code.

We’ll be back with more later.
