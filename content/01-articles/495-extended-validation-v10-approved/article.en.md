As I posted earlier on Opera Labs, work has been under way to create an improved process, Extended Validation (EV), for issuing web site certificates that can give a higher degree of assurance to the user that the SSL/TLS website in question really is who it claims it is, and how to tell the browsers that this process has been used.
