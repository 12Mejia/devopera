## Added patches

PATCH-250, Allow <a href="http://www.play.com/" target="_blank">play.com</a> searching with Enter. The form with the search field contains two input images. Usually the first one should be used. The site has a script to use the second one - this event handling failed in Opera and you would be sent to the login page instead.

PATCH-249, XML namespace parsing on officeapps.live.com. Loading documents on <a href="http://skydrive.live.com/" target="_blank">Skydrive</a> would hang forever. Opera doesn&#39;t handle namespaced attributes in getNamedItem/removedNamedItem like others. This will enable loading of documents - a big improvement - be aware though that editing is somewhat shaky.

PATCH-248, Jive forum software doesn&#39;t work in Opera. Should improve usage of <a href="http://forums.adobe.com/" target="_blank">Adobe forums</a>

In addition we have pushed a mask for the chat functionality on <a href="http://www.orkut.com/" target="_blank">Orkut</a> through override_downloaded.ini. Still randomly fails.
