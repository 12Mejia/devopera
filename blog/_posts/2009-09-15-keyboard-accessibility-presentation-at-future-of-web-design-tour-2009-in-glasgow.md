<p>On Monday, 14 September, I had the pleasure of speaking at the Glasgow leg of the <a href="http://events.carsonified.com/fowd/2009/tour/">Future of Web Design Tour 2009</a> on the topic of <cite>Keyboard accessibility - basic steps towards a more usable and accessible site</cite>.</p>
<p>The slides are available in <a href="http://people.opera.com/patrickl/presentations/FOWD_14.09.2009/FOWD_14.09.2009.odp">OpenOffice (7.5MB)</a> and <a href="http://people.opera.com/patrickl/presentations/FOWD_14.09.2009/FOWD_14.09.2009.pdf">PDF (9.85MB)</a> format. Also, make sure to fact-check the results of my small experiment to find a <a href="http://people.opera.com/patrickl/experiments/keyboard/test">better CSS outline suppression</a>.</p>
<p>It was great to meet up with the local web design and development community, and I’m glad my presentation – and fellow Opera colleague <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk">Bruce Lawson</a>’s reprise of his <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2009/future-of-web-design-glasgow/"><cite>Future of HTML 5</cite></a> overview – went down well.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the fine folks at <a href="http://carsonified.com">Carsonified</a> for the perfect venue and flawless organisation, and a special thanks to <a href="http://forabeautifulweb.com">Andy Clarke</a> and <a href="http://boagworld.com">Paul Boag</a> for agreeing to let their sites be ripped apart and used as examples.</p>
