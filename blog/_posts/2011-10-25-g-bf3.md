## Added patches

- PATCH-527, Add more spoofing when masking as another browser on Amazon to make menus work. Kind of an unofficial patch specifically for Valynor as it only is active when spoofing/masking. This defect has nothing to do with our earlier patch attempts, just yet another way to ignore Opera.
- PATCH-526, G+: avoid tall narrow posts due to word-wrap in table. Core bug.
- PATCH-525, origin.com: fix `readyState` on `HTMLScriptElement` removed from document — it should be `complete` even after removal. Caused never ending load.

## Changed patches

PATCH-505, YouTube: avoid deadlock when changing volume. Ever changing function names…
