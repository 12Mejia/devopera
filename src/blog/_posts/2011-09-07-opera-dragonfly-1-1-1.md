Weâ€™ve just released Opera Dragonfly 1.1.1, a maintenance release of 1.1. A small set of bugs has been fixed:<br/><ul class="bullets"><li><code>console.dir</code> was incorrectly working the same way as <code>console.dirxml</code>, returning a DOM tree instead of an expandable object.</li><li>Editing inherited CSS properties would incorrectly remove non-inherited properties from the declaration block.</li><li>Fixed an escaping issue in the CSS inspector.</li></ul>
