<span style="font-size: 140%">Added patches</span><br/><br/>PATCH-383, Avoid sniffing that prevents itinerary lines on Google Maps. An update on Google&#39;s side caused some faulty sniffing. Temporary patch until they can push a fix.<br/><br/>PATCH-382, Google Spreadsheets cell size and column label size mismatch. Opera gets WebKit styling, while it should get Gecko styling - causing the gray areas and cell highlight mismatches.<br/><br/>PATCH-325, Y!Mail - improve browser sniff workaround.<br/><br/>PATCH-238, Override minmax IE helper script on yoka.com.
