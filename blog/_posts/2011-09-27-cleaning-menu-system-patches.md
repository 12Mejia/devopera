## Added patches

- PATCH-509, cnnturk: work around CSS bug that causes footer content to float upwards as margins collapse.
- PATCH-506, YouTube: avoid Silverlight uploader. Core bug where passing Array-like objects between browser and plug-in fails. Now opera falls back to Flash uploader. Ideally it would use the new XHR uploader, but Opera hasn&#39;t implemented the upload methods of XHR2 yet.
- PATCH-503, Work around Transmenuâ€™s browser sniffing.
- PATCH-498, Yahoo! Japan services block Opera from using Silverlight plugin in sniffing script.
- PATCH-494, Washingtonpost: avoid articles being overwritten in race condition.
