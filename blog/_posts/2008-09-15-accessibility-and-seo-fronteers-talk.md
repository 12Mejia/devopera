<p>On Friday 12 September, <a href="http://www.vasilis.nl">Vasilis van Gemert</a> and I delivered a few slides as part of a panel presentation at the <a href="http://fronteers.nl/congres/2008/english">Fronteers conference</a> in Amsterdam.</p>

<p>Here are the slides. Attached notes have the longer quotes and URLs referred to.</p>

<li><a href="http://files.myopera.com/brucelawson/blog/fronteers-final.pdf">fronteers-final.pdf</a> (564k)</li>
</ul>

<p>The panel was <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/mirabeau/videos/1/">videoed</a>, and I&#39;ll post a link to the transcription when it&#39;s ready. In the meantime, you might like my thinkVitamin article <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/design/accessibility-in-suit-and-tie">Accessibility in suit and tie</a> or my article on the Web Standards Project about the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/2008/09/08/uk-government-draft-browser-guidance-is-daft-browser-guidance/">UK government draft browser testing guidelines</a>.</p> <p>I&#39;d like to thank Vasilis, my co-presenter, for all his help, and all the Fronteers people for their hospitality. I had a great time, as you can see from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/24374884@N08/sets/72157607266468302/">my photos</a> and <a href="http://vasilis.nl/photos/digitaal/fronteers_2008/">Vaslis&#39; pictures</a>.</p>
