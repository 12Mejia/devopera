<p>We&#39;re closing in on the final release of Opera Dragonfly and we’ve made a number of release candidates since the last post. There have been no new features, only bug fixes. We’d like your feedback on the stability of the builds and if any functionality is broken or regressed from the previous version. Once we are happy with the quality of the product we will finalise the build and start release preparations. Thank you for all your help testing Opera Dragonfly, and let us know what you think in the comments.</p>
