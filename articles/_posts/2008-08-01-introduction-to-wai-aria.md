intro: 'The elephant in the corner of modern web development has been Ajax accessibility.

The W3C has been working on a new technology called ARIA - Accessible Rich Internet Applications - that provides a way for “Web 2.0” developers to bridge the gap between desktop-like interaction and accessibility.

When I was reading up on ARIA, I found that I couldn’t see the big picture because the specifications focus on the detail. So we asked Gez Lemon of The Paciello Group, Juicy Studio and the Web Standards Project’s Accessibility Task Force to write us an overview that would help developers understand what ARIA is, why it’s important, and how they can use it right now to help users with disabilities.'
