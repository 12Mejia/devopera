intro: 'JavaScript has allowed us to create animations on our web pages for a number of years, with JavaScript libraries making such code easier to create and more reliable cross-browser. CSS3 animations, a more recent contender, also allow us to create animations on web pages, although they are currently not quite as reliably supported cross-browser. Which one should you use? This article compares the two approaches in terms of performance and other benefits.'
