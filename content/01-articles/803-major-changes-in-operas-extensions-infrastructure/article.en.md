<p>With Opera switching from Presto to Chromium and a complete UI remake, our extensions infrastructure has also gotten a major overhaul: from Opera 15 onward, <strong>Opera 11 &amp; 12’s extension format is no longer supported, and instead, we’ve switched to Chromium’s extension model</strong>. At this point, Opera 15 (available as <a href="http://www.opera.com/next/">Opera Next</a>) supports a subset of the Chromium extension APIs — with more to come —, as well as our own Speed Dial API.</p>

<p>If you want to upgrade your existing Opera extension to the new format, you can use the conversion tool we’ve built into the Opera extensions catalog’s <a href="https://addons.opera.com/developer/">developer interface</a> and test if the extension works as expected (<a href="http://dev.opera.com/extension-docs/tut_conversion.html">detailed steps</a>). Of course, you can also reuse an existing Chromium extension or create a new one from scratch. There&#39;s a whole <a href="http://dev.opera.com/extension-docs/">new tutorial section</a> with API documentation, examples and more for you to get started.</p>

<p>We’re looking forward to getting the <a href="https://addons.opera.com/extensions/">Opera extensions catalog</a> filled with exciting new extensions in the next few months, and will be expanding our support for Chromium extension APIs, as well as adding new Opera-specific APIs.</p>

<p>As for themes, Opera 15 ships with a couple of preset themes, but third party themes are not supported at the moment; however, we plan to bring theming functionality back in the near future, so stay tuned.</p>
