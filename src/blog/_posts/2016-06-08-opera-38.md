Opera 38 (based on Chromium 51) for [Mac, Windows, Linux](https://www.opera.com/computer) is out! To find out what’s new for users, see our [Desktop](https://www.opera.com/blogs/desktop/) blog. Here’s what it means for web developers.

## ES6 `Symbol.hasInstance`

Constructors can now implement their own `Symbol.hasInstance` method, which is used by `instanceof` to determine whether a constructor object recognizes an object as its instance.

## ES6 subclassing using `Symbol.species`

[The `Symbol.species` accessor property](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-symbol.species) allows subclasses to [override](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-speciesconstructor) the default constructor for objects.

For example, `Array.prototype.map` constructs instances of the subclass as its return value, with the option to customize this by changing `Symbol.species`.

	class MyArray extends Array {
		static get [Symbol.species]() {
			// Return the parent `Array` constructor.
			return Array;
		}
	}
	const foo = new MyArray(1, 2, 3);
	console.log(foo instanceof MyArray); // true
	console.log(foo instanceof Array);   // true
	const mapped = foo.map(x => x * x);
	console.log(mapped instanceof MyArray); // false
	console.log(mapped instanceof Array);   // true

## ES6 `RegExp` subclassing

Previous versions of the JavaScript spec always used the original value of `RegExp.prototype.exec` in other methods such as `String.prototype.replace` — there was no way to override `exec` programmatically to change the core matching algorithm. In ES6 this is finally possible, which enables subclassing `RegExp` without having to duplicate any higher-level integration logic:

	class MyRegExp extends RegExp {
		exec() {
			return ['Hello from MyRegExp!'];
		}
	}

	const re = new MyRegExp('foo');
	'bar'.match(re);
	// ['Hello from MyRegExp!']

## ES6 `Function.prototype.name`

In ES6, the `name` property is sometimes set even on anonymous functions, based on the syntactic position of the function or class expression.

	const foo = function() {};
	const bar = () => {};
	console.log(foo.name); // 'foo'
	console.log(bar.name); // 'bar'

## ES6 iterator closing

Iterators are now checked for a `close` method which is called if the loop terminates early. This can be used for clean-up duty after the iteration has finished.

## ES6 `Array.prototype.values`

[The `values` method for arrays](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-array.prototype.values) returns an iterator over the contents of the array. This is similar to `Map.prototype.values` for maps or `Set.prototype.values` for sets.

## Iterable array-like DOM interfaces

Any DOM interfaces containing indexed property getters and `length` properties now have a `Symbol.iterator` that makes them [iterable](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#es-iterators). This means that things like `NodeList`, `HTMLAllCollection`, `FileList`, or `MediaList` can now be looped over by using `forEach` or `for-of`.

	for (const element of document.querySelectorAll('p')) {
		element.textContent += ' Hurray!';
	}

## Passive event listeners

Passive event listeners are a new feature [in the DOM spec](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-eventlisteneroptions-passive) that enable developers to opt-in to better scroll performance by eliminating the need for scrolling to block on touch and wheel event listeners. Developers can annotate touch and wheel listeners with `{ passive: true }` to indicate that they don’t invoke `preventDefault` to get a massive scroll performance boost.

For more information, read [the explainer document](https://github.com/WICG/EventListenerOptions/blob/gh-pages/explainer.md) or [check out the demo](https://rbyers.github.io/scroll-latency.html).

## `KeyboardEvent.prototype.key`

[The `key` property on `KeyboardEvent` instances](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#events-keyboard-key-location) is now implemented. It returns the string value of the key (or keys) pressed by the user to generate the event. Check out [the demo for `key` specifically](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/keyboardevent-key-attribute/) or play around with [the keyboard event viewer](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/tools/key-event-viewer.html).

## Intersection Observer API

The brand-new [Intersection Observer API](https://wicg.github.io/IntersectionObserver/) makes it easy to efficiently track when a given element in the DOM enters the visible viewport or leaves it. For more information, check out [Surma’s write-up](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/04/intersectionobserver) or [the explainer document](https://github.com/WICG/IntersectionObserver/blob/gh-pages/explainer.md), or [view a demo](https://wilsonpage.github.io/in-sixty/intersection-observer/).

## Presentation API

[The Presentation API](https://w3c.github.io/presentation-api/) enables accessing external presentation-type displays and using them for presenting web content. [A demo is available.](https://storage.googleapis.com/presentation-api/index.html)

## Service workers: `ExtendableMessageEvent`

`ServiceWorker.prototype.postMessage()` now results in an [`ExtendableMessageEvent`](https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/#extendablemessage-event-section) fired on `ServiceWorkerGlobalScope` as a `'message'` event. Before this change, `postMessage()` resulted in a `MessageEvent` fired on the global scope.

Calling [the `waitUntil(promise)` method](https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/index.html#extendable-event-waituntil-method) of an `ExtendableMessageEvent` instance extends its lifetime until `promise` is settled.

To experiment with this, view [the service worker `postMessage()` demo](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/service-worker/post-message/).

## Web Audio API: `OfflineAudioContext.prototype.length`

[`OfflineAudioContext`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#idl-def-OfflineAudioContext) instances now have a `length` that indicates the number of frames that the offline context will render.

## WebRTC: promise-based `RTCPeerConnection` methods

The following `RTCPeerConnection` methods are now promise-based, matching [the updated spec](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/):

* [`addIceCandidate`](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#dom-rtcpeerconnection-addicecandidate)
* [`createAnswer`](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#dom-rtcpeerconnection-createanswer)
* [`createOffer`](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#dom-rtcpeerconnection-createoffer)
* [`setLocalDescription`](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#dom-rtcpeerconnection-setlocaldescription!overload-1)
* [`setRemoteDescription`](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#dom-rtcpeerconnection-setremotedescription!overload-1)

## CSS `border-image` now follows the spec

Chrome and Opera now require a border style in order to paint `border-image`s, matching [the spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#the-border-image). If you’re affected by this change, add e.g. `border-style: solid` where `border-image` is used.

## Percentage sizes of flex item children

According to the spec, certain flex items have [definite sizes](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-flexbox/#definite-sizes). If a child element of such a flex item uses percentage-based sizes, these are now handled correctly. [A visual demo is available.](http://jsbin.com/zefuxiviso/2/edit?html,output)

## `SameSite` cookie attribute

The [cookie attribute](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07) formerly known as “First-Party-Only” or “First-Party” allows servers to mitigate the risk of [CSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29) and information leakage attacks by asserting that a particular cookie should only be sent with requests initiated from the same domain.

## `AES_256_GCM` for TLS

To simplify server configuration and negotiate modern ciphers with more existing servers, Chrome and Opera now offer the `AES_256_GCM` cipher suite for TLS connections. See [the intent to implement](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/blink-dev/5BmCy4Gx3gs/ShdUGrLqAQAJ) for details.

## Deprecated and removed features

`URL.createObjectURL` and `URL.revokeObjectURL` are now deprecated in service worker contexts.

For security reasons, custom messages in `onbeforeunload` dialogs are [no longer used](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/blink-dev/YIH8CoYVGSg/Di7TsljXDQAJ).

DHE-based TLS ciphers are now deprecated and support for them will be removed at some point in the future. A warning message is logged to the DevTools console whenever such a cipher is used. Servers should upgrade to ECDHE ciphers instead.

Chromium 51 / Opera 38 no longer negotiates SPDY over HTTPS connections. Sites using it return to negotiating HTTP/1.1, unless they upgrade to HTTP/2. [Use HTTP/2 instead.](https://blog.chromium.org/2016/02/transitioning-from-spdy-to-http2.html)

A related feature removal is that of NPN, which was the TLS extension used to negotiate SPDY. During the standardization process, NPN was replaced with [ALPN](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7301).

The non-standard `results` attribute for `<input type=search>` is now deprecated. In Chrome and Opera, it’s a purely cosmetic feature that adds a magnifier icon to the input field. In desktop Safari, it controls [how many submitted queries are shown](https://developer.apple.com/library/iad/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariHTMLRef/Articles/Attributes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008058-results) in a popup opened by clicking the magnifier icon.
