_[UPDATE] Added Bulgarian, Tamil, Telugu, Turkish and Ukrainian, which I accidently missed from the list._

* `bg`: Bulgarian
* `cs`: Czech
* `da`: Danish

You can change the UI language of Opera Dragonfly by clicking the settings icon (lower right hand corner), clicking the general expander (the text is now clickable as well as the arrow icon), and select the language from the drop down list.

This release is scheduled to be the last release on the Scope protocol 3 branch, which is for Opera Presto 2.1 based browsers, such as Opera 9.6. Full focus will now be on Scope protocol 4 based releases for Opera Presto 2.2, and the upcoming Opera Dragonfly alpha 4 release. You can track progress of this by using builds of Opera 10. Much requested features such as automatically detecting the active tab are now working in the Scope 4 branch of Opera Dragonfly.
