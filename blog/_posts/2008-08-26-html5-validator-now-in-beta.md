<p>News just in (<a href="http://twitter.com/karlw3c/statuses/899215102">via Twitter</a>) from Karl Dubost of the W3C.  The <a href="http://qa-dev.w3.org/wmvs/HEAD/">HTML5 validator</a> is now in beta and available on the W3C site.  This will make it much easier to experiment with new HTML5 elements and attributes, and make sure they are valid.  Go check it out.</p>

<blockquote><p>We are happy to announce that W3C has integrated a version of HTML 5 conformance checker into a beta instance of the W3C Markup validator. That will help us to detect bugs, improve the user interface, and benefit from the large W3C communities. <cite>â€“ <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2008/08/html5-validator-beta">Karl Dubost</a></cite></p></blockquote>
