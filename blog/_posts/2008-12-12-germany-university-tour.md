<p>After 7 days, 10 universities and a lot of cool discussions during evening meet-ups, Opera&#39;s Geman university tour has comes to an end.</p>

<p>For everybody who attended the seminars and meetups, a BIG DANKE! The Opera team that was present in Germany were <a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/">H책kon Wium Lie</a>, <a href="http://annevankesteren.nl/">Anne van Kesteren</a>, <a href="http://robertomateu.com/">Roberto Mateu</a> and <a href="http://my.opera.com/goessling/">Bernd Goessling</a>. Here goes the slides.</p>

<p>Here are <a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2008/talks/11-germany.html">H책kon&#39;s &quot;One Web&quot; slides</a>. H책kon&#39;s slide uses Opera Show. By going F11 full screen in Opera, you can go into presentation mode.</p>

<p>Here are <a href="http://annevankesteren.nl/2008/university-tours-germany-html5">Anne&#39;s slides on HTML 5</a>. You can watch these slides in the same manner as H책kon&#39;s. If you fancy trying out the video demos, you will need <a href="http://labs.opera.com/downloads/">Opera&#39;s experimental video build</a>.</p>

<p>Roberto&#39;s talk is about <a href="/blog/germany-university-tour/GER%20tours%20slides.pdf">Web Browser Industry PDF 850kb</a>. This presentation includes trends in the browser industry, Opera&#39;s products and some use case examples.</p>
