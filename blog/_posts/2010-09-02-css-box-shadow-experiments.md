Back from its temporary disappearance from the specification, <a href="temporarily disappeared from the specification">CSS <code>box-shadow</code></a> is widely supported in all the modern browsers.<br/><br/>my.Opera blogger <a href="http://my.opera.com/AntonDiaz/blog/">Anton Diaz</a> has made some pretty cool <a href="http://files.myopera.com/AntonDiaz/pages/box-shadow-tricks.html" target="_blank"> experiments using <code>box-shadow</code></a>. <br/><br/>There are some <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/css/103170/" target="_blank">browser comparison screenshots</a> so you can see the state of support (the article is in Russian, but for the cyrillic-impaired, the CSS and images tell the story well enough, or you can deduce the sense through <a href="http://bit.ly/aK97Md ">Google translate</a>). It&#39;s fair to say that these are experimental, and not yet ready for production websites until browsers catch up, but they&#39;re interesting techniques.<br/><br/><small>Hat-tip to Vadim Makeev.</small>
