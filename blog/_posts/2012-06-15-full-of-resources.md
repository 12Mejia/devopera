<p>Many changes in the Resource Inspector have landed into an Experimental build of  Opera Dragonfly. The main goal of this update is to give a more natural and focused access to the resources of your page or application.
<p>The resources are no longer displayed in a flat table but organized in a structured tree representing the document, children documents and their various groups of resources such as markup, stylesheets, scripts, images, and so on.
<p><span class='imgcenter'><img alt='' src='/blog/full-of-resources/0search.png' /></span>
<p>This new Resource Inspector opens the resource previews in a single panel on the right hand side where you can perform inline searches.
<p><span class='imgcenter'><img alt='' src='/blog/full-of-resources/0image.png' /></span> 
<p>More types of resources are recognized. For instance you can now preview web fonts and type any text to get a better feel of them.
<p><span class='imgcenter'><img alt='' src='/blog/full-of-resources/0fonts.png' /></span>
<p>The short description in the resource preview gives the encoding and MIME type sent to Opera along with the deduced type and a link to open the resource in a new tab.
<p>This is a work in progress. Things might still feel a bit rough here and there. We will need your feedback to improve this feature of Opera Dragonfly. A few known issues:
<ul class="bullets"><li>The last selected tab is not remembered.</li><li>The position of the scrollbars is not remembered.</li><li>Keyboard navigation is missing.</li><li>SVG images might be interpreted as both image and frame.</li></ul>
<p>However this is a first step towards a better Resource Inspector. Soon it will be possible to filter the structured tree of resources and to preview a whole group of resources at once. You might also notice some improvements to the profiler in this Experimental build of Opera Dragonfly. Enjoy ;) </p>
