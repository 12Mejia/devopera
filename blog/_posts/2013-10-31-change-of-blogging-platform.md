<p>As announced on the <a href="http://my.opera.com/chooseopera">Choose Opera</a> blog, we&#39;re closing the my.Opera blogging platform in five months&#39; time. This change also affects the ODIN blog. (If you use my.Opera to host any personal blogs or photos, be sure to read the post on how to export your data.)</p>
<p>For the time being, we&#39;ll continue blogging here, but in a few months, we&#39;ll merge this blog into our all new Dev.Opera site, which we&#39;re currently rebuilding from scratch.</p>
<p>So, for now, just stick around — once the new Dev.Opera is ready, you&#39;ll find all this blog&#39;s content and future posts on Dev.Opera!</p>
