<p><em>[UPDATE] Added Bulgarian, Tamil, Telugu, Turkish and Ukrainian, which I accidently missed from the list.</em></p>

<p>This release is scheduled to be the last release on the Scope protocol 3 branch, which is for Opera Presto 2.1 based browsers, such as Opera 9.6.  Full focus will now be on Scope protocol 4 based releases for Opera Presto 2.2, and the upcoming Opera Dragonfly alpha 4 release.  You can track progress of this by using builds of Opera 10.  Much requested features such as automatically detecting the active tab are now working in the Scope 4 branch of Opera Dragonfly.</p>
