<p>The web standards curriculum was donated to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/webed/">W3C web education community group</a>, to become part of a much bigger educational resource, and the most up-to-date version is now available at the <a href="http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Main_Page">docs section of the W3C webplatform.org site</a>. We are hoping to have translation facilities on here very soon, but until then if you want to start creating translations of the webplatform.org material, you can host them on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/Main_Page">web education community group Wiki</a>, with a view to move them over to webplatform when the translation facilities are added. Please make changes to this Wiki yourself, or suggest changes to <a href="mailto:cmills@opera.com">Chris Mills</a>, who is also the chair of the web education community group.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Now that the final section of the Web Standards Curriculum is complete we are focusing on translating as much of it as we can into as many languages as possible. While we are working on translations ourselves we also welcome contributions from elsewhere.</p>

<p>If you want to get involved in a new translation effort, or be put in touch with any of the translators to contribute to their works, feel free to drop me a mail at cmills [at] opera [dot] com.</p> 

<h2>The translations</h2>

<p>What follows are a list of links to the translations. I’ve tried to include author credits and other details where possible, but if there&#39;s anything missing/incorrect that you’d like to add, get in touch.</p>

<p>These translations are hosted elsewhere so we can&#39;t vouch for the quality of the pages. We are however looking at a process whereby we can better verify translations in the future. In the meantime we ask that translations are as accessible and faithful to web standards as possible.</p>

<h3>Brazilian Portugese</h3>

<p>There are 4 articles so far <a href="http://danillonunes.net/curriculo-dos-padroes-web/">translated into Brazilian Portugese</a>—a great start so far from <a href="http://my.opera.com/danillonunes/about/">Marcus Danillo</a>.</p>
