<p>This week saw the release of Opera 10.10 final complete with a more accessible <a href="http://unite.opera.com/">Opera Unite</a>. If you&#39;ve not come across Opera Unite before it&#39;s a powerful platform that turns your browser into a server. This means that you can share content you have on your hard drive - photo&#39;s, files, folders, music, hosted websites - without having to uploaded these to a website.</p>

<p>There are benefits for all users but for those who struggle with the accessibility of social networks where they&#39;d normally share photo&#39;s, files and information Opera Unite offers a fast, accessible and usable alternative. With this release we&#39;ve added in some accessibility enhancements that we believe will benefit not just disabled but all users:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Default applications now have better page structure</li>
	<li>Higher contrast has been added to links</li>
	<li>It is possible to exit Slideshow and the Fridge with the keyboard</li>
	<li>ARIA has been added in some places to announce updates to screenreaders</li>
	<li>Overall keyboard accessibility has received some general tweaking</li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;re not stopping there however and would love to hear your feedback, comments and ideas. Drop me an email or leave a comment if you have any. Finally a special thank you to our Accessibility Volunteers for their input and ideas.</p>
