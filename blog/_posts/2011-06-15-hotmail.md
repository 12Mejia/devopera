Only once patch this time, for a problem that most of you probably haven&#39;t seen yet :)<br/><br/>PATCH-428 - new version of Live Mail / Hotmail is unusable. Can&#39;t view messages, click folders or compose messages. Luckily all issues stem from one Core issue, Opera does not fire load event for object tags when loading script or style resources, causing scripts to be &quot;missing&quot;. Loading scripts into object tags is a technique to download but not execute a script until needed.<br/><br/>This new version of Hotmail is probably a gradual roll out, so most users will still not have seen this issue.
