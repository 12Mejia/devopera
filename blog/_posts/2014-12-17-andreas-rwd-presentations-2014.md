Earlier this year, I had the chance to speak at [Fluent](http://fluentconf.com/fluent2014/public/schedule/detail/32540) in San Francisco, and at [State of the Browser](http://browser.londonwebstandards.org/andreas-bovens/) in London. At both events, I talked about various new CSS features that have become available in mobile browsers and allow you to create compelling responsive designs.

The topics I covered in these talks included:

- [device adaptation](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-device-adapt/) aka `@viewport`
- [`resolution` media queries](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#resolution)
- [`object-fit`](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-images-3/#the-object-fit) & [`object-position`](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-images-3/#the-object-position)
- [viewport-percentage lengths](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#viewport-relative-lengths)

In the introduction to both presentations, I also went for a short trip down memory lane, and talked about the fascinating work of [Karl Gerstner](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Gerstner), a Swiss graphic designer and type pioneer who published an influential book called “[Programme entwerfen](http://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/en/programme-entwerfen)” (1964), exploring the role of design in the early days of the computer era. The photo below shows you some of his experiments with programmatic design, and, to me at least, they are an early precursor of the whole “responsive design” concept. Visionary stuff!
