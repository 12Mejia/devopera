A freezing start of the new year (-15â„ƒ in Oslo today) so the start is slow, only for 12.1x this time. <br/><br/><span style="font-size: 140%">Added patches</span><br/><br/>PATCH-1099, YouTube comments: bad opacity animation performance in Presto caused high CPU and slow loading of &quot;All comments&quot;. Workaround is to skip the animation.<br/><br/>PATCH-1097, razri.com: CSS url() argument takes quotes.<br/><br/><span style="font-size: 140%">Removed patches</span><br/><br/>PATCH-1080, hp.com - missing background gradient. Site updated, no longer uses offending code.<br/><br/>We&#39;ll be back with more later.
