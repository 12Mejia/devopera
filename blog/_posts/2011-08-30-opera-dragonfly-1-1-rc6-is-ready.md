<p>After a couple of bugfixes and some newly found issues with pseudo-elements in release candidate 5, we now consider 1.1 ready. RC6 is live on the <a href="http://my.opera.com/dragonfly/blog/getting-opera-dragonfly-ready-for-opera-11/#enable">experimental path</a>, if nothing serious gets found, it will be launched as 1.1 soon. It also has all translations that were previously missing, so please feel free to try those too.</p>
<p>Also see the list of <a href="https://dragonfly.opera.com/app/stp-1/experimental/logs/4940.48c453e12e9f.log">changes since RC5</a>. Please let us know in the comments if you find anything striking, we appreciate it!</p>
