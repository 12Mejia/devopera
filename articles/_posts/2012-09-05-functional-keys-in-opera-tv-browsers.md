intro: 'Browsers based on the Opera Device SDK are generally designed to use the standard four-way directional keys on a remote control for spatial navigation.

This article outlines some possible approaches, particularly in light of the new DOM Level 3 Events model introduced in the Opera Device SDK 3.4.'
