The Desktop Team <a href="http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2011/09/13/es5">has released</a> an exciting update to Presto (Opera&#39;s rendering engine) and Carakan (Opera&#39;s JavaScript engine). Most notably, this snapshot includes <strong>full support</strong> for <a href="http://www.ecmascript.org/" target="_blank">ECMAScript 5.1</a>, the latest official version of the ECMAScript specification. In addition to adding all of the new built-ins and strict mode, we&#39;ve fixed lots of minor spec compliance glitches and other bugs.<br/><br/>To get a sense for why this is so exciting for both developers and end-users, just check out the difference in results for <a href="http://test262.ecmascript.org/">test262</a> (the official test suite) between Opera 11.51 and today&#39;s 12.00 pre-alpha snapshot:<br/><br/>Opera Next snapshot:  Pass: 10926 | Fail: 1| Failed To Load: 0<br/>Opera 11.51 Final:  Pass: 7062| Fail: 3865 | Failed To Load: 66<br/><br/>And the one test this snapshot fails is <a href="https://bugs.ecmascript.org/show_bug.cgi?id=179" target="_blank">likely invalid</a>.<br/><br/>If ES5 isn&#39;t your thing, we&#39;ve still been working hard on completing our support for HTML5 as well. In this snapshot the tireless <a href="http://twitter.com/foolip">Philip JÃ¤genstedt</a> has landed the @muted (CORE-40275) and @preload (CORE-19293) attributes for HTML5 &lt;video&gt;.<br/><br/>Finally, a fun CSS bug was fixed (CORE-28884) allowing <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/p4zuZ/">box-shadows for &lt;input&gt; elements</a> to finally work as you would expect.<br/><br/>Go grab the <a href="http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2011/09/13/es5">snapshot</a> while it&#39;s still hot and be sure to check out the full changelog!
