<p>If you&#39;re serious about your JavaScript and fanatical about web app development, you should already be familiar with the <a href="http://2012.full-frontal.org/">Full Frontal</a> conference. Missed your chance to grab a ticket for this year? Don&#39;t fret, we may be able to help...</p>

<p>Due to some scheduling clashes, we&#39;ve got a spare ticket for the conference, as well as a place on <a href="http://2012.full-frontal.org/#mobile">Remy Sharp&#39;s &quot;Mobile Web Apps&quot; workshop</a>...in all, two days of intense JS and web app knowledge (8-9 November).</p>

<p>Want to get your hands on the tickets? Here&#39;s the deal: in the run-up to releasing Opera 12.10, our <a href="http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/">desktop team</a> been busy adding support for new standards (such as the <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/fullscreen/raw-file/529a67b8d9f3/Overview.html">Fullscreen API</a> and the latest <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">WebSockets protocol</a>). We&#39;re currently in the process of getting a few simple demos ready to showcase these new technologies...but maybe you&#39;ve already got a cool idea of how they could be put to good use. If so, we&#39;d love to see what you come up with!</p>

<p>Make something awesome, and you&#39;ll not only get your 15 minutes of fame on our <a href="http://shinydemos.com/">Shiny Demos</a> site, but you&#39;ll also be in with a chance to snag the tickets to Full Frontal.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Updated deadline:</strong> Deadline for your submission (either as a link to your work – left as a comment on this blog post or tweeted to <a href="https://twitter.com/odevrel">@ODevRel</a> – or an actual pull request on the <a href="https://github.com/operasoftware/shinydemos">Shiny Demos repository on github</a>) is the <strong>2 November 2012 at 23:59 CET</strong>.</p>

<p>Good luck, and most of all have fun!</p>
