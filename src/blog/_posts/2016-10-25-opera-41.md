Opera 41 (based on Chromium 54) for [Mac, Windows, Linux](https://www.opera.com/computer) is out! To find out what’s new for users, see our [Desktop](https://www.opera.com/blogs/desktop/) blog. Here’s what it means for web developers.

## Web Components: Custom Elements v1

Custom elements form the foundation of [web components](http://webcomponents.org/). The initial version of the API, also known as Custom Elements v0, has been supported since Opera 20 & Chrome 33. With the v0 API, a new custom element was defined using `document.registerElement()`.

Since then, the spec has been updated based on web developer and browser vendor feedback. The improved API is called [Custom Elements v1](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#custom-elements). The new hip & trendy way of defining a custom element is through `customElements.define()`. The v0 API is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

For more details, check out [Eric Bidelman’s custom elements guide](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/customelements).

## DOM convenience methods on `ParentNode` & `ChildNode`

We now support the following convenience methods on [ParentNode](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#parentnode) and [ChildNode](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#childnode) for working with DOM trees:

- `ParentNode.prototype.prepend()`
- `ParentNode.prototype.append()`
- `ChildNode.prototype.before()`
- `ChildNode.prototype.after()`
- `ChildNode.prototype.replaceWith()`

## `CanvasRenderingContext2D.prototype.imageSmoothingQuality`

[`CanvasRenderingContext2D.prototype.imageSmoothingQuality`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#imagesmoothingquality) allows developers to balance performance and image quality by adjusting resolution when scaling.

	const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
	const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
	const image = new Image();
	image.src = 'image.png';
	image.onload = function() {
		context.imageSmoothingEnabled = true;
		context.imageSmoothingQuality = 'high'; // or 'low', or 'medium'
		context.drawImage(image, 0, 0, 320, 180);
	};

## BroadcastChannel API

[The BroadcastChannel API](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#broadcasting-to-other-browsing-contexts) allows same-origin scripts to send messages to other browsing contexts. It can be thought of as a simple message bus that allows publish-subscribe semantics between windows, tabs, `iframe`s, web workers, and service workers. Think of it as a simpler, same-origin version of the good ol’ `postMessage()` API.

For more information, check out [this article](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/09/broadcastchannel).

## Cache Storage API: `CacheQueryOptions`

The full set of [`CacheQueryOptions`](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/#dictdef-cache-cachequeryoptions) is now supported, making it easier to find the cached responses you’re looking for. Here’s the complete list of available options:

- `ignoreSearch`
- `ignoreMethod`
- `ignoreVary`
- `cacheName`

See [Jeff Posnick’s excellent article](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/09/cache-query-options) for more information.

## CSS `text-size-adjust`

[The `text-size-adjust` property](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-size-adjust/) lets web developers control and disable [the text autosizing feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-size-adjust) which increases font sizes on mobile.

## Unprefixed CSS `user-select`

You can now use [`user-select`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-ui-4/#content-selection) instead of `-webkit-user-select` in CSS. The `user-select` property makes it possible to specify which elements in the document can be selected by the user and how.

## Navigations in `unload` handlers now blocked

Navigations initiated in an `unload` handler are now [blocked](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/blink-dev/VfItzNe3WO0/Zo95RMlTAwAJ). Instead, any prior navigation will continue. This matches the behavior in Firefox, and matches Edge’s behavior more closely than before.

## `Node.prototype.getRootNode`

Sites can use [Node.prototype.getRootNode(options)](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-node-getrootnode) to obtain the root for a given node.

## Experimenting with post-quantum crypto for TLS

CECPQ1 is a post-quantum cipher suite: one that is designed to provide confidentiality even against an attacker who possesses a large quantum computer. It is a key-agreement algorithm plugged into TLS that combines X25519 and NewHope, a ring-learning-with-errors primitive. Even if NewHope turns out to be breakable, the X25519 key-agreement will ensure that it provides at least the security of our existing connections.

Note that this is only an experiment. In fact, the plan is to discontinue this experiment within two years, hopefully by replacing it with something better. See [“Experimenting with post-quantum cryptography”](https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html) for more details.

## Deprecated and removed features

`URL.createObjectURL` and `URL.revokeObjectURL` are now deprecated in service worker contexts.

[The MediaStream API](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/) dropped `MediaStream.prototype.ended` a long time ago. Its usage has been [deprecated since Opera 32 & Chromium 45](https://dev.opera.com/blog/opera-32/#mediastream-api). As of this release, the `ended` event is no longer supported.

Similarly, [the File API spec](https://w3c.github.io/FileAPI/) once removed the `FileError` interface. It has been deprecated since 2013. Any usage of `FileError` triggered a warning in the DevTools console [since Opera 40 & Chromium 53](https://dev.opera.com/blog/opera-40/#deprecated-and-removed-features). As of this release, `FileError` is no longer supported.

Support for the non-standard `TouchEvent.prototype.initTouchEvent` has been removed, after being [deprecated since Opera 36 & Chromium 49](https://dev.opera.com/blog/opera-36/#deprecated-or-removed-features). Use [the `Touch` and `TouchEvent` constructors](https://dev.opera.com/blog/opera-35/#touch-and-touchevent-constructors) instead.

To more closely match other browser’s behavior, `window.external.IsSearchProviderInstalled` and `window.external.AddSearchProvider` (originally intended to [add search engines programmatically](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sidebar/Adding_search_engines_from_Web_pages)) are now both no-ops. This functionality was never implemented in Safari. In IE10, these methods are (mostly) no-ops: `IsSearchProviderInstalled` always returns `2`, and `AddSearchProvider` always returns `S_OK`. Firefox still implements this, but notes that it may be removed at any time.

`KeyboardEvent.prototype.keyIdentifier` has been removed. Use [`KeyboardEvent.prototype.key`](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#dom-keyboardevent-key) (or [its polyfill](https://github.com/cvan/keyboardevent-key-polyfill)) instead.

## What’s next?
