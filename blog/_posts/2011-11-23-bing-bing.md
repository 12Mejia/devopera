## Added patches

- PATCH-545, Bing Image Search adds history entries when scrolling results. Core bug where `location.replace` for changing the hash adds history entries.
- PATCH-544, teledeporte.es: fix `<iframe>` resize. Good old SSIframe-sniffing
- PATCH-543, yihaodian.com: fix wrongly aligned product image.

## Changed patches

PATCH-514, paper.li: allow clicking headers despite lack of pointer-events. First patch broke sliders for video content.
