<h3>What is <span lang="id">Carakan</span>?</h3>
<p><span lang="id">Carakan</span> is Opera&#39;s new JavaScript engine. It&#39;s still in development, but is already 2.5 times faster than our Opera 10 alpha engine (which itself is 30% faster on real websites than previous versions of Opera). Some aspects are between 5 and 50 times faster!</p>
<h3>Why are we developing it?</h3>
<p>Because we can! Opera has always been about speed, security and a small memory footprint, so we&#39;re constantly improving these aspects of the browser. Many of today&#39;s web applications depend heavily on JavaScript, and we&#39;re developing what will be <strong>the fastest ECMAscript engine on the market</strong>.</p>
<h3>When will <span lang="id">Carakan</span> be available?</h3>
<p>Soon. We&#39;ve chosen to talk about it now as we&#39;re discussing it at the <a href="http://north.webdirections.org/">Web  Directions North conference</a>, but we&#39;re still combing its hair and  straightening its tie before we&#39;re ready to let you see it.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>It&#39;s a combination of brilliant coding and Scandinavian voodoo magic (&quot;Snowdoo&quot;). If you want more details about the brilliant coding, you can read all about register-based bytecode, automatic object classification and native code generation on the <a href="http://my.opera.com/core/blog/2009/02/04/carakan">Opera Core Concerns Blog</a>. We&#39;re sworn to secrecy about the Snowdoo. By a <del>Yeti</del> <ins>troll</ins>.</p>
<h3>What does &quot;<span lang="id">Carakan</span>&quot; mean?</h3>
<p>We thought about naming it &quot;Unicorn-badger&quot;, &quot;StackDonkey&quot; or &quot;Shouting Otter&quot;. But, we&#39;ve chosen the name &quot;<span lang="id">Carakan</span>&quot; (pronounced &quot;Jarakan&quot;), which is the <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/javanese.htm">original  alphabet from the Indonesian island of Java</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, it&#39;s the purest Java Script. When you try it, you&#39;ll agree.</p>
