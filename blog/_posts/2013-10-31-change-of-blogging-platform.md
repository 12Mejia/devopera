As announced on the [Choose Opera][1] blog, we’re closing the my.Opera blogging platform in five months’ time. This change also affects the ODIN blog. (If you use My.Opera to host any personal blogs or photos, be sure to read the post on how to export your data.)

For the time being, we’ll continue blogging here, but in a few months, we’ll merge this blog into our all new Dev.Opera site, which we’re currently rebuilding from scratch.

So, for now, just stick around — once the new Dev.Opera is ready, you’ll find all this blog’s content and future posts on Dev.Opera!
