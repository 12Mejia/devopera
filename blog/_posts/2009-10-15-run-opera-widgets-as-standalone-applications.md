Over at <a href="http://labs.opera.com/news/2009/10/15/">Opera Labs</a>, we have just released a desktop build that allows you to run Opera Widgets as standalone desktop applications. With this release, widgets are getting a complete make-over from being small, single-purpose gadgets to first-class citizens with the power to replace native applications. <br/><br/>Differently phrased, this means that any web developer with knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS can create a desktop application. And for good measure and scaling goodness, you can even throw in some SVG magic as well!<br/><br/>Below, I&#39;ve included a screenshot of my Mac running the <a href="http://labs.opera.com/downloads/twitter.wgt">Twitter widget</a>. Note the Twitter icon shown in the Dock, the native Chrome and shadow, and the fact that Opera is not running.<br/><br/><img src="/blog/run-opera-widgets-as-standalone-applications/standalone-widget-smaller.png" alt="Screenshot of standalone Twitter widget" width="640" /> <br/><br/>You can find detailed information about installation, running, debugging widgets on this Labs build on <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-desktop-widgets-evolved/">Dev.Opera</a>. If you want to get started building your own widgets, there is of course our <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-widgets-sdk/">Widgets SDK</a>. <br/><br/>Note: there are currently some issues to get the <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/widget-emulator/">Widget Emulator</a> running well on Opera 10.10 builds â€“ we are investigating this and working on a fix. For the time being, we recommend to use the Widget Emulator in Opera 10.<br/><br/>And of course, let us know what you think in the comments!
