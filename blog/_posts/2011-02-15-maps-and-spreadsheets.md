## Added patches

PATCH-383, Avoid sniffing that prevents itinerary lines on Google Maps. An update on Google&#39;s side caused some faulty sniffing. Temporary patch until they can push a fix.

PATCH-382, Google Spreadsheets cell size and column label size mismatch. Opera gets WebKit styling, while it should get Gecko styling - causing the gray areas and cell highlight mismatches.

PATCH-325, Y!Mail - improve browser sniff workaround.

PATCH-238, Override minmax IE helper script on yoka.com.
