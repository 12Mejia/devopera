<p>Today&#39;s release on the stable branch of Opera Dragonfly includes many of the recent enhancements and fixes from our experimental builds.</p>

<p>Apart from a boatload of small tweaks and bug fixes, some of the top new features and additions include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://my.opera.com/dragonfly/blog/css-shorthands">CSS shorthands</a> in the Style Inspector, which removes a lot of the redundancy of having all expanded and default styles being listed <img src="{{ page.id }}/shorthand-css.png" alt="A set of CSS rules shown in the style panel as a shorthand" /></li>
<li><a href="http://my.opera.com/dragonfly/blog/whats-new-in-opera-dragonfly-with-opera-next">JavaScript runtime errors</a> shown directly as a tooltip in the Script panel, rather than just in the Error panel <img src="{{ page.id }}/error-tooltip.png" alt="A JavaScript runtime error shown directly in the script&#39;s source code as an error tooltip" /> </li>
<li><a href="http://my.opera.com/dragonfly/blog/more-dynamic-javascript-value-inspection">More dynamic JavaScript value inspection</a> with a powerful tooltip that now also allows for function evaluation <img src="{{ page.id }}/tooltip-plus.png" alt="Function evaluation showing the result in the tooltip" /></li>
<li><a href="http://my.opera.com/dragonfly/blog/2012/02/14/improved-script-select">Improved script selection</a> dropdown, with filtering and improved keyboard support <img src="{{ page.id }}/script-select.png" alt="Script selection dropdown" /></li>
<li>The style panel now also allows you to use your preferred color format (Hex, RGB or HSL), which can be changed in Settings → Documents → Styles <img src="{{ page.id }}/blog-color-option.jpg" alt="Changing the preferred color format in  Settings → Documents → Styles" />
</li></ul>
<p>These features have been in our experimental builds for a while now, so we&#39;re very pleased to now unleash them on our stable release branch. As ever, we welcome our users&#39; feedback and suggestions. Enjoy!</p>
