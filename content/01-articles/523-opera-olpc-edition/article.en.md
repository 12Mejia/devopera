<p>
This is a special edition of the Opera desktop version - the Opera OLPC Edition.
</p>
<p>
We have been testing Opera on the OLPC laptop since we received the &quot;lean-mean-green-machine&quot;, as some here at the office like to call it. I have been keeping both the Opera page on the OLPC Wiki as well as my own blog up-to-date about work on it.  
	We feel the time to be ready to show you the progress we have made.
