As you know, My.Opera soon closes. The current content of this blog will be exported and probably hosted under Dev.Opera for future reference. The GitHub [repository][1] will continue as is.

This post is also my last public appearance as an Opera employee, as I will move on to other adventures after next week.

Do not worry though, the maintenance of Browser.js will be passed on to capable compatibility hands owned by Aleksei known from the desktop blog.

Future sitepatching blog posts are also likely to appear under the new desktop or mobile blogs over at blogs.opera.com

I don’t know how many old time readers are left here, but I will like to thank you all for the comments, complaints, patches and fixes over the years. Although the purpose of this work was often to conceal more or less silly mistakes in a temporary way, you, the users, made it meaningful and worthwhile.

And now for something completely different;
