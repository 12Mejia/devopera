The <a href="http://www.wacapps.net/web/portal" target="_blank">Wholesale Applications Community</a>, commonly referred to as WAC, has published <a href="http://specs.wacapps.net/wac1_0/dec2010/overview.html" target="_blank">specifications</a> and <a href="http://www.wacapps.net/web/portal/sdk" target="_blank">an SDK</a> to increase the functionality of mobile applications written in web languages. The WAC 1.0 specification contains APIs in categories such as:<br/><br/><ul class="bullets"><li><strong>PIM</strong>: for accessing contacts and calendar information</li><li><strong>Multimedia</strong>: for accessing multi-media capabilities such as the camera</li><li><strong>Device</strong>: for accessing information about the phone</li><li><strong>Messaging</strong>: for sending SMS for example to access mobile devices</li></ul><br/>For Android users wishing to try out these capabilities, we recently released a <a href="http://labs.opera.com/news/2011/02/14/" target="_blank">WAC-1.0-compliant widget runtime for Android</a>. To accompany this, we also looked after developers by providing an <a href="http://team.opera.com/widgets-sdk/" target="_blank">Opera Widget plugin for Eclipse</a> and an early version of the Opera Widget Desktop Emulator with WAC 1.0 API support.<br/><br/>Following on from these releases, we&#39;ve now created a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0qdrxG-Ipk" target="_blank">video tutorial that shows how to make a simple WAC widget</a> that can access a mobile device&#39;s camera. In the screencast, we use Eclipse and the Opera Widget plugin to create a widget that takes photos and then run the widget from within the IDE.<br/><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="381" scrolling="no" src="http://embed.myopera.com/video/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dg0qdrxG-Ipk&amp;height=375&amp;width=620" width="626" />
And once you&#39;ve watched that, don&#39;t forget that we also have a written <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/building-a-widget-with-wac/" target="_blank">tutorial showing how to build a spirit level widget</a> using WAC 1.0.
