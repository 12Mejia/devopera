I was invited to give a talk to the inaugural NLHTML5 meet-up in Amsterdam about how web standards have been made in the past, and how that will change in the future. [Slides are available](https://brucelawson.github.io/talks/2015/NLHTML5/) and here’s a YouTube video made by the organisers. (As this was written for an evening meet-up in Amsterdam, there may be language in it that isn’t appropriate for your workplace.)

My talk was followed, chronologically and thematically, by a presentation by Robin Berjon of W3C that delves into actually how developers can contribute to making more nimble web standards: [Make Forks Not War (slides)](http://berjon.com/presentations/20150115-nlhtml5/#/), [video](http://youtu.be/KpCaWhvlnnQ). The same caveat about language applies.
