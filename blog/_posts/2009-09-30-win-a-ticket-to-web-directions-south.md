<p>One of the most exciting conferences of the year is almost upon us,
web friends. The <a href="http://south09.webdirections.org/" target="_blank">Web Directions South conference</a> in Sydney Australia, part of <a href="http://webweek.com.au/" target="_blank">Australian Web Week</a>, is running from October 6-9 and promises a
wealth of interesting and informative talks on everything from Web
Fonts and SEO to Canvas programming and developer tools.</p>

<h2>Opera running wild in Australia</h2>

<p>Opera has a long history of supporting Web Directions events, and
this year is no different. We are sponsoring the main conference, and
giving numerous talks throughout the week:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I am attending the main Web Directions South conference, co-hosting the <a href="http://south09.webdirections.org/workshops#ed-directions" target="_blank">Ed Directions education workshop</a>, and speaking at <a href="http://south09.webdirections.org/werock" target="_blank">WE Rock</a>, <a href="http://webjam.com.au" target="_blank">WebJam</a> and <a href="http://www.ignitesydney.com/" target="_blank">Ignite Sydney</a>. Phew!</li>
  <li>Lachlan Hunt is giving Opera&#39;s point of view on the <q>State of
the Web as a Platform</q> panel</li>
  <li>Daniel Davis is turning up to meet a lot of new faces, talk the
talk and walk the walk, and generally be sociable. He is dedicating a
lot of his time to working on Widgets, so should be able to answer any
questions you have on those</li>
</ul>

<p>We are all looking forward to having some great conversations, so
come up and talk to us!</p>

<h2>Competition time</h2>

<p>Ok, here&#39;s some exciting news - Opera have a free ticket for the
main Web Directions South conference going spare, and we are offering it up as a
competition prize.

<p>To get a chance to win, all you have to do is
submit an abstract detailing what you would do to showcase the new
breed of web standards - CSS 3, HTML 5, SVG, etc. Give us at the minimum some
sketches, mockups, etc, and a couple of paragraphs of description, and
submit your entry by 23.58 GMT Sunday October the
4th. You can post it on your blog (or in a Google doc, perhaps) and give
us the URL below in the comments.</p>

<p>We will then judge the competition and announce the winner on Monday October the 5th.</p>

<p>The only condition is that the showcase idea must work in Opera 10. The winner will be invited to write up their showcase as an article to be published on the <a href="http://dev.opera.com" target="_blank">dev.opera.com</a> front page!</p>

<p>The winner will get their name put down for a free ticket at the
door of WDS (please note that we are only supplying the free ticket,
not paying for travel costs!)</p>
