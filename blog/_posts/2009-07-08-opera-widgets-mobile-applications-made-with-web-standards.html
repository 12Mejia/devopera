<p>Another standard that Opera is involved with is the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets/" target="_blank">Widgets specification</a>. Widgets are standalone applications that are made with <abbr>HTML</abbr>, <abbr>CSS</abbr> and JavaScript. They are zipped up with an <abbr>XML</abbr> configuration file  that describes their size on the screen, or whether they&#39;re full screen, whether they can connect to the Internet etc. The zipped file is renamed .wgt and then they can be sent to a mobile phone (or Archos tablet, Nintendo Wii, Web TV, or anything else). The device&#39;s Widget Manager then unzips them and installs them automatically.</p>
<p>What&#39;s great about this is that it allows developer to make web-enabled applications that can look like native apps, but which are made with Web Standards. And, because they&#39;re made with Standards, they work anywhere that can support a full web browser.</p>
<p>Opera has released a full <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-widgets-sdk/">Widgets SDK and documentation</a>, together with a  <a href="http://widgets.opera.com/">Widget repository</a>—think <em>free appstore</em>—so you can try them out and get inspiration for your own Widget. You can also see how <a href="http://carsonified.com">Carsonified</a> made their <a href="http://twiggy.carsonified.com">Twiggy Widget</a>.</p>
<p>At the moment, they&#39;re supported by Opera desktop, Opera for devices and Opera Mobile. Once the <abbr>W3C</abbr> specification is completed, we will amend our implementation to follow the Open Standard and expect other browser vendors to support them.</p>
<p>The mobile phone industry is very interested in Widgets. Vodafone Netherlands recently ran a <a href="http://widgetdevcamp.nl/">Widgets development camp</a> in Amsterdam to get developers making Widgets prior to their launch of a Vodafone appstore, which will allow developers to charge money for their work.</p>
<p>Today, Vodafone have announced their <a href="http://www.betavine.net/summer/summer.html">Summer of Widgets competition</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.betavine.net/summer/summer.html"><p>Each WEEK during the Vodafone and Betavine Summer of Widgets competition, three prize packages of a Samsung NC 20 Netbook bundled with a Nokia N96 handset will be awarded to the three best new widgets.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t win you can still feature your app in our Apps Shop live in eight countries across Europe! The competition starts on 6th July so that&#39;s three bundles, every week for the next eight weeks.</p></blockquote>
