Brian Suda is an informatician currently residing in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. He has spent a good portion of each day connected to Internet after discovering it back in the mid-1990s. Most recently, he has been focusing on the mobile space - how smaller devices will augment our every day life and what that means to the way we live, work and are entertained. His own little patch of Internet can be found at [suda.co.uk](http://suda.co.uk) where many of his past projects and crazy ideas can be found.
