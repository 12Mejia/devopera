In our latest experimental build we have improved the tooltips in the JavaScript source view. Normally, inspecting a value should not change the current state in any way. For that reason, we never included parentheses in the automatic detection and selection of a value to prevent function calls. Now you can control this behaviour: if you hold the <code>shift</code> key while hovering over the JavaScript source, parentheses will be included.<br/><br/>For example, for a code fragment of <code>ele.getElementsByTagName(&#39;ul&#39;)[0]</code>, you normally get a generic tooltip for the <code>[0]</code> array when hovering over the square bracket.<br/><span class='imgcenter'><img alt='' src='/blog/more-dynamic-javascript-value-inspection/1without-shift.png' /></span><br/>With <code>shift</code>, the automatic selection will also include the parentheses and you will now get a tooltip relating to the evaluated selection â€” in this case, the first <code>ul</code> element in the <code>ele</code> object.<br/><span class='imgcenter'><img alt='' src='/blog/more-dynamic-javascript-value-inspection/0with-shift.png' /></span><br/>Additionally you can select any text, hold down the <code>shift</code> key, and get a tooltip with the according evaluated value.<br/><span class='imgcenter'><img alt='' src='/blog/more-dynamic-javascript-value-inspection/select-with-shift.png' /></span> <br/><br/>Selection now also works over several lines.<br/><br/>We have also added a new tooltip for all JavaScript inspections. For properties of type <code>object</code> we show the according class. If you now hover over the class name of any Element, Function, Date, RegExp, Error and Exception, you will get a tooltip with a pretty-printed representation. This also works on top of an other tooltip:<br/><span class='imgcenter'><img alt='' src='/blog/more-dynamic-javascript-value-inspection/tooltip-plus.png' /></span> <br/>If you hover the pretty-printed tooltip of an element, the according node in the document gets scrolled into view and highlighted.<br/><br/>This is all available on experimental now. Take a look and tell us what you think!<br/>
