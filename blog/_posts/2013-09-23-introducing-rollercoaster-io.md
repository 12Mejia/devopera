intro: '[Coast by Opera](http://coastbyopera.com/) has been out for 2 weeks now. During that time, we’ve been browsing a lot on our iPads and we’ve noticed that there are still relatively few sites that are really optimized for tablet browsing: Coast by Opera gives you a good experience on non-optimized sites as well, but still, things can always be better. So, we started working on a **simple site that highlights pretty, tablet-optimized sites and best design practices:** the result is [Rollercoaster.io](http://rollercoaster.io/).'

<p><a href="http://coastbyopera.com/">Coast by Opera</a> has been out for 2 weeks now. During that time, we&#39;ve been browsing a lot on our iPads and we&#39;ve noticed that there are still relatively few sites that are really optimized for tablet browsing: Coast by Opera gives you a good experience on non-optimized sites as well, but still, things can always be better. So, we started working on a <strong>simple site that highlights pretty, tablet-optimized sites and best design practices</strong>: the result is <a href="http://rollercoaster.io/">Rollercoaster.io</a>.</p>

<p>We&#39;re kicking things off with five site reviews, and the idea is that this grows to a nice collection of sites, which you can flick through using the navigation buttons, or with a simple left or right swipe gesture.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll be reviewing more sites ourselves in the next weeks and months that come, but we welcome external contributions as well! Just fork our repo, and <a href="https://github.com/operasoftware/rollercoaster/blob/master/README.md">follow the instructions</a>. As the site is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, it&#39;s just a matter of putting a markdown and an image file in the right folders, and you&#39;re good to go.</p>

<p>And if even that&#39;s too much effort ;-) give us a shout on <a href="https://twitter.com/odevrel">Twitter</a> about sites you think we should review!</p>
