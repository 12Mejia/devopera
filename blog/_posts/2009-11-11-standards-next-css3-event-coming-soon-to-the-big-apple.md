<p>With two successful Standards.Next events behind us, we are taking the show on the road to the Big Apple for an event focusing on CSS3. As always, the event is free and anyone can attend. <a href="http://www.standards-next.org">Standards.Next CSS3</a> will take place on the 20<sup>th</sup> November at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-Life_Building">Time-Life building</a> in New York City.  Time &amp; Life Inc. have generously let us use one of there rooms for the day. Space will be limited so please register your interest on the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/4878729/">events Upcoming page</a>. If we reach capacity people will be admitted on a first come, first served basis, so please turn up early if you want to absolutely guarantee a spot. We hope to have space for everyone though.</p>

<p>For a free event we have a stellar line up of speakers, and you could be amongst them. At the present moment we have confirmed that <a href="http://www.molly.com/">Molly E. Holzschlag</a> and <a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/">HÃ¥kon Wium Lie</a> of Opera will be presenting, along with top selling CSS author <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/">Andy Budd</a> and Internet Explorer Product Manager <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/petel/">Pete Le Page</a>. We will also have lighting talks from interested participants.</p>

<p>The Web design world has been abuzz about CSS3 for along time now, with <code>border-radius</code> being the poster child, along with Web Fonts. We will show these and the many more features of CSS3 that are available now and the near future. With at least two members of the CSS Working Group in attendance, the event will be a perfect way to give feedback on the current and future direction of CSS. We are looking forward to meeting some of your there.</p>
