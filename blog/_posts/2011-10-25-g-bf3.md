<span style="font-size: 140%">Added patches</span><br/><br/>PATCH-527, Add more spoofing when masking as another browser on Amazon to make menus work. Kind of an unofficial patch specifically for Valynor as it only is active when spoofing/masking. This defect has nothing to do with our earlier patch attempts, just yet another way to ignore Opera.<br/><br/>PATCH-526, G+: avoid tall narrow posts due to word-wrap in table. Core bug.<br/><br/>PATCH-525, origin.com: fix readyState on HTMLScriptElement removed from document - it should be &#39;complete&#39; even after removal. Caused never ending load. <br/> <br/><span style="font-size: 140%">Changed patches</span><br/><br/>PATCH-505, YouTube: avoid deadlock when changing volume. Ever changing function names...
