I was honoured to be invited to speak in Cape Town, South Africa, at <a href="http://csforum2012.com/">Content Strategy Forum 2012</a>. My talk was <a href="http://people.opera.com/brucel/talks/2012/csforum/">HTML5 101 for Content Specialists</a>. <br/><br/>This is the second talk I&#39;ve done using an HTML5/ CSS framework rather than Open Office or other proprietary presentation software. This one is called <a href="https://github.com/pepelsbey/shower" target="_blank">Shower</a>, written by our own Vadim Makeev, and is open source. <br/><br/>My personal perspective on the conference and visiting South Africa is available at <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2012/notes-on-contents-strategy-forum-2012-cape-town/">Notes on Contents Strategy Forum 2012, Cape Town</a> on my personal blog.
