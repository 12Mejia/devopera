In November 2015, my colleague [Mathieu](https://twitter.com/p01) and I visited Singapore to attend [CSSConf.asia](http://2015.cssconf.asia/) and [JSConf.asia](http://2015.jsconf.asia/). Here’s a summary of our presentations.

## Making real-time audio-visual demos

At JSConf.asia, Mathieu spoke about creative coding, bringing the [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) to the web, and crazy JavaScript optimization tricks. He then proceeded to code an audio-visual demo from scratch, live on stage, using nothing but web standards.

## Random CSS fun facts

I had the pleasure of presenting at CSSConf.asia, and used that opportunity to showcase a series of obscure CSS fun facts, such as CSS syntax gimmicks and quirks, weird tricks that involve CSS in one way or another, and security vulnerabilities that are enabled by (ab)using CSS in unexpected ways.

In case you’re into that kind of stuff, there’s some terrible CSS puns at the end. ([#cssbandnames](https://twitter.com/search?q=cssbandnames), anyone?)
