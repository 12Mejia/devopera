<p>
April 30th, 1997 (give or take a few days; remembering exact days can be hard) 
	was the first time Opera&#39;s SSL implementation completed a full transaction.
</p>
<p>
The four months prior to this largely unnoticed (but for Opera significant) event, had been very busy.
	I had to study and learn about SSL and general cryptography, then do intense design and development work,
	followed by a lot of testing and debugging.
</p>
<p>
The SSL support in Opera was my first assignment when I started working at Opera. You might say that I was
	thrown in at the deep end. The benefit, of course, was that my hands weren&#39;t tied by a pre-exisiting design.
