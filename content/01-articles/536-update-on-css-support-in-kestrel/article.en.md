While Kestrel is getting ready to spread its wings, we are currently busy adding new features to Core-2 and deep into the QA process. I&#39;ve already mentioned the CSS3 selectors are done and dusted, but what else is new since the last report? Not forgetting about CSS2.1, we&#39;re adding support for white-space: pre-line;. This edges us ever closer to full CSS2.1 support...
