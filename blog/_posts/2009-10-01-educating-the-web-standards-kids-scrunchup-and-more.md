In a blog post a couple of months ago, I asked <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2009/08/19/how-do-we-educate-the-web-standards-kids" target="_blank">How do we educate the web standards kids?</a>. This elicited quite a few good responses, so I thought I&#39;d follow up on this subject and give a couple of updates.<br/><br/>First of all, <a href="http://scrunchup.com/issue-1/" target="_blank">the first issue of ScrunchUp</a> is finally out, and it looks great. You can find the first part of my article, <a href="http://scrunchup.com/issue-1/a-proper-web-standards-education/" target="_blank">A proper web standards education</a>, a <a href="http://scrunchup.com/issue-1/employment-and-portfolios/" target="_blank">guide to employment and portfolios</a> from Paul and Marcus Headscape, and much much more useful stuff. It is aimed at the younger generation, just getting into web design.<br/><br/>Secondly, things have been progressing for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/owea/" target="_blank">Open Web Education Alliance</a>. We have been steadily working on a whitepaper to present to the W3C management folk, explaining how our curriculum will be put together, how our outreach work to educators will work, etc. More on this soon!<br/><br/>Last, I am jetting off to Australia for a couple of weeks of work very soon. I will be doing lots of education work over there, and meeting a lot of passionate folk to get on board the standards education movement, no doubt! <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2009/09/30/win-a-ticket-to-web-directions-south" target="_blank">Find out more about my activities, and enter our competition</a>!
