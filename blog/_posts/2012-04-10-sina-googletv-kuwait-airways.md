## Changed patches

- PATCH-614, sina.com.cn: video doesn’t play due to missing script readystate support. Make it apply to more subdomains.
- PATCH-603, GoogleTV: fix broken word spacing — Opera bug. Make it apply to more subdomains.

## Removed patches

PATCH-493, kuwaitairways.com — Fix browser sniffing. Site changed. Our DevRel team contacted them a year ago, but didn’t reach the correct people. They tried contacting different people yesterday. Today it was fixed :) More often than one could imagine, getting results in tech is more about knowing the right people than actual technical things.
