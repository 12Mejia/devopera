<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The university tour is now over, and I am quite sad - it was an amazing tour to go on, and I met so many gifted students and educators, and connected with so many friends, old and new. I&#39;m  starting to feel pretty encouraged about the web education mission, as there are a number of schools/unis that are really doing things right, with respect to web education, and the number is increasing. Each SXSWi, we meet more educators who are interested in getting things right and teaching industry best practices, and are just finding out about the resources we are making available. We also meet a bunch more who we&#39;ve never spoken to before, but who are already using our curricula in their programs. The latter is even cooler than the former, imo ;-)</p>

<p>My experience at each one of the schools I visited was fairly similar - they all had good teachers teaching solid web best practices, the students were passionate and asked good questions, and the sessions were well-attended. You might say I was kind of preaching to the converted, but I would say that it was still thoroughly worthwhile visiting these places to forge stronger links, raise awareness of Opera/browser choice, and get students experimenting with CSS3/HTML5 features and giving feedback.</p>

<p>I gave the same presentation, on HTML5 and CSS3, at each venue. <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/university-talk-resources-march-2010-html5-css3-slides">Download my slides and code examples here</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to thank everyone who helped with putting these talks together, and all those who attended.</p>

<h2>March 5th: Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK</h2>

<p>Attendees: about 50-60</p>

<p>A gentle introduction to the tour, I visited MMU, which is right on my doorstep. I was taken around and bought lunch by Richard Eskins, one of the lecturers there, and the talk was pretty well-attended. You could tell that people were into it, because we overran and had to change rooms, but most of the audience followed the other room to see the lecture through to completion! I also had a nice chat with some local developers about further meetups and talks.</p>

<h2>March 9th: Art Institute of Atlanta, Georgia, USA</h2>

<p>Attendees: about 100</p>

<p>Aside from being fed Thai food three times in 36 hours (seriously guys - don&#39;t sweat it! ;-) ), this was one of the best events of the tour. I was picked up by Troy Bennett from AiA the night before the event, and we went out for some food and beer and chatted about music and web stuff.</p>

<p>In the morning I was picked up by web faculty chair Ameeta Jadav, and we went the AiA campus, toured the departments, and I even found time to do a little work. I was very impressed with their facilities - everything from sound engineering to catering! We went to lunch, got a bit more work done, then it was time for us to go to the lecture theater. The place was packed, and I was introduced to so many students, who asked great questions. My lecture went down very well, and I heard audible <q>ooohs</q> and shouts of <q>yesss!</q> when showing off some of the HTML5 and CSS3 features. Ameeta Jadav, the program chair, said that I am welcome back anytime, and also gave this nice bit of feedback:</p>

<blockquote><p>If this is any indication of your impact, I asked my class today to name
four popular browsers. The answer was Opera, Safari, Firefox and Chrome...they
mumbled IE but did not want to say it. I had to dig IE out of them by asking
follow-up questions. <cite>--Ameeta Jadav, AiA</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>I also had loads of students saying that they would try Opera, or are already liking Opera.</p>

<h2>March 10th: University of Texas in Austin, Texas, USA</h2>

<p>Attendees: about 30-40</p>

<p>I headed up to UT with the magical Mrs Glenda Sims, Faruk Ates, and Leslie and Shaun. We had a bit of time to chill before the talk, which I was giving to the UT computer science society, so we had a chat, and I got to check out the prototype of <a href="http://www.shauninman.com/archive/2010/02/23/mimeo_and_the_kleptopus_king">Shaun&#39;s new game</a>, which is pretty mind blowing stuff. It was a privilege to see it! I went in there and delivered the goods, and while the audience wasn&#39;t quite as suitable as previous talks (some of the CS guys were of the attitude of &quot;well, we can do this stuff programmatically, so why bother with this CSS3 stuff??&quot;, kind of missing the point), it still seemed to go down fairly well. There were a few web staff from the university there as well, who were interested in finding out more about the new specs.</p>

<h2>March 12th-16th: Break for SXSWi</h2>

<p>I use the term <q>Break</q> here in the loosest possible way. See my <a href="http://my.opera.com/chrismills/blog/2010/03/20/sxswi-2010-march-12-16-2010">SXSWi 2010 report</a> for more details.</p>


<h2>March 17th: Texas State Technical College, Waco, Texas, USA</h2>

<p>Attendees: about 50</p>

<p>After SXSWi I jumped in the car of the delectable Ms Deann Graham, web design instructor at <acronym title="Texas State Technical College">TSTC</acronym> Waco, and we took a nice drive up to her neck of the woods! It was interesting to check out Waco, as I&#39;d only heard of it before because of all the Waco cult stuff. I must say that everyone I met was really friendly and personable - thanks for the hospitality!</p>

<p>On the day of the talk, I had a look around the campus, then we had lunch and went to the lecture theater. There was a good crowd present, mostly of Deann&#39;s students, but also some local industry folk and people from other local colleges - this was really encouraging. the talk went well, lots of good questions were asked, and afterwards I was interviewed for local TV by Jay Hicks, an incredibly talented student of Deann&#39;s who got me to talk about the web education movement, and outed this metal warrior as a fan of old-school hip hop ;-)</p>

<p>I&#39;m most digging the Gravediggaz&#39; first album currently...</p>

<h2>March 19th: University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA</h2>

<p>Attendees: about 70-80</p>

<p>After a car ride up to Dallas to catch a plan, and a few hours of travel, I made it to Chattanooga airport and got picked up by the Inmans (Chatt airport is so cute - only about 3 planes and a dog at any one time). We had some dinner and then went back to their place to chill, watch stupid Youtube videos and jam. Shaun and myself went through a whole gamut of good retro US alternative stuff, including Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Weezer, NIN, Pixies, and more, after which we went to sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning we went to get breakfast and then made our way over to the UTC campus. I really enjoyed this talk - full of passionate students, educators and local developers/designers, who were all blown away by the new CSS3/HTML5 features, and asked some really great questions! another one of my favourite talks of the tour! We had a lunch reception with pizza and more good conversations, and then proceeded to sit down and work on our <a href="http://www.interactwithwebstandards.com">InterACT with web standards book</a>. Leslie and Jessi Taylor have produced an amazing layout/design for the book, and I am blown away by incredible skill by which Jessi has interpreted by notes and produced the final diagrams for the book. They look so sweeeeet!</p>

<p>By this point I had received tonnes of great feedback over mail and Twitter. The attendees had even mailed the organizers of the different talks to send praise and thanks, for example:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thank you for the invite and for organizing the event. Chris&#39; talk was really impressive. It&#39;s exciting that so much is happening in the world of web! <cite>--Jessica Martin, CreateHere</cite></p></blockquote>

<h2>Second break - The wookie went down to Georgia</h2>

<p>With a few days (including a weekend) in between the <acronym title="University of Tennessee at Chattanooga">UTC</acronym> talk and the <acronym title="University of Georgia">UG</acronym> talk, I decided to go down to Athens early to hang out with my friend and <acronym title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</acronym>/<acronym title="Open Web Education Alliance">OWEA</acronym> compadre, Mr Aarron Walter. We had a great time, eating good food, drinking beer and hanging out with his lovely wife Jamie and some of the other great people of Athens. What an amazing vibrant place - so much art/creativity.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t all play though - we needed to spend some time doing work on my book, and I needed to catch up on some Opera work. All of Sunday was spent working.</p>

<h2>March 23rd: University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, USA</h2>

<p>I actually did the talk twice on this day, once to the DWEEBS, a collection of UGA web faculty and staff, and local webbie folk, and once to the UGA <abbr title="Masters of Information Technology">MIT</abbr> program.</p>

<p>Both talks went really well, and I had a lot of people asking great questions, and saying they&#39;d try Opera.</p>

<h3>The DWEEBS</h3>

<p>Attendees: about 50</p>

<h3>The UGA MIT program</h3>

<p>Attendees: about 40-50</p>
