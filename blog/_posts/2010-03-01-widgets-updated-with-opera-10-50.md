<p>Most of the cool features introduced in Opera 10.20 alpha have now made it into Opera 10.50 final so here&#39;s a reminder of the extra power and flexibility the latest generation of our widget runtime offers. ... </p><!--more-->First, a quick recap of the benefits of widgets:<br/><ul class="bullets"><li>A standards-based way to build cross-platform apps â€” HTML, JavaScript and CSS knowledge are all that&#39;s needed.</li><li>Being installed locally means they don&#39;t need to eat bandwidth by downloading resources with each use.</li><li>Your information does not need to be stored by a third party on a web server.</li></ul><br/><span class='imgright'><img alt='' src='http://files.myopera.com/tagawa/blog/svg-edit_small.png' /></span> This is already encouraging, but there&#39;s more! With the latest 10.50 improvements, widgets offer even greater advantages for those looking to easily develop useful and enticing applications for a broad range of users:<br/><ul class="bullets"><li><strong>Independence from the browser:</strong> you can run widgets from the start menu without starting Opera.</li><li><strong>OS chrome:</strong> integrate with the user&#39;s environment by using the operating system&#39;s window and titlebar.</li><li><strong>Access to the filesystem:</strong> read and write to local files, with the user&#39;s permission, of course.</li></ul><br/>These enhancements pave the way for compelling, native-feel applications built with web standards. Coupled with our improved HTML5 and CSS3 support, it&#39;s now easier than ever for developers to delight end users, show off to their peers or simply scratch their own itch.
