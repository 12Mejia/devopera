Core bug.<br/><br/><span style="font-size: 140%">Changed patches</span><br/>Updated HVmenu patch to detect another special case on <a href="http://www.cfbu.cz" target="_blank">http://www.cfbu.cz</a><br/><br/>Changed iframe resize patch on systadin.fr to make it work again.<br/><br/>In other news Opera Mobile now has its own browser.js. For some time many recent phone projects have shared the Windows Mobile file since they more or less share Core code. The name of the file is now updated to say &quot;Opera Mobile&quot; instead of &quot;Opera Winmobile&quot;.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
