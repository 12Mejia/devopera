<p>The team has been hard at work to deliver a nice christmas present for developers! We have an experimental release ready for you to try out (change the URL in <code>opera:config#DeveloperTools</code> to point to <code><a>https://dragonfly.opera.com/app/stp-1/experimental/</a></code>) and make it run on <a href="http://opera.com/next/">Opera Next</a>. Let&#8217;s see what you get:</p>

<h3 id="better_network_data">Better Network Data</h3>

<p>Network performance is the first website optimization you should do, and the Opera Dragonfly team has been hard at work to make this even better! You now get a better overview of all the resources as they get loaded, including graphs of how each resource loads and data on the time spent. </p>

<p>Do note that this UI is far from final, and we await your feedback to iterate over it.</p>

<h3 id="script_tooltips">Script Tooltips</h3>

<p>I mentioned on the previous post that we have tooltips that display when you hover on a JavaScript object. It has now been integrated (and with better styles!) which you can see in action in this build. </p>


<h3 id="css_shorthands">CSS Shorthands</h3>

<p>There are more fixes for CSS shorthands, the default values are no longer shown for font and background properties. You can now have an easier time debugging CSS! </p>

<p>I have included here a video demonstration of how both these features would work for you:</p>

<object width="560" height="315"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Zng4yzE_Eg8?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="never" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Zng4yzE_Eg8?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="never" /></object>

<p>This build includes all the recent changes except the profiler in one neat new package. Hope you have fun exploring and debugging your webpages with Dragonfly! Do let us know if you come across any issues!</p>
