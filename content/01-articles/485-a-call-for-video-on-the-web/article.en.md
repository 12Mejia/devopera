<p>It&#39;s time to make video a first-class citizen of the web. We, the users, have video cameras in our pockets and the bandwidth to tranfer more clips and streams than we can watch. What&#39;s missing is a an easy way to integrate video into web pages, and native support for video in browsers. We, the web community, should address this by adding a <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#video">video element</a> to HTML.</p>
<p>In addition to giving video an HTML element, we must also agree on a baseline video format that will be universally supported, just like the GIF, JPEG and PNG image format are universally supported. It&#39;s important that the video format we choose can be supported by a wide range of devices an that it&#39;s royalty-free (RF). RF is a well-establish principle for W3C standards.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.theora.org/">Ogg Theora</a> format is a promising candidate which has been <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Video">chosen by Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>At Opera, we have built an <a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2007/video/op950_8762_video_repack_with_lgpl_signed.exe">experimental version
</a> that has native support for Ogg Theora. For now, it is only available on Windows.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Do not choose to start Opera in the installation process. After installing, exit the installation process and start the the experimental build manually.</strong></p>
