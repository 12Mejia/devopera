<p>Coding is great, and reading web specifications is a joy like no other, but all work and no play can make Jack a dull boy, so it&#39;s important that we don&#39;t overlook The Shiny.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why at Opera we made <a href="http://shinydemos.com/">Shiny Demos</a>, a collection of demos that show off the latest web specs in an <i>Ooooo!</i> sort of way. Rock pianos, Andy Warhol, Hixie Keyboards, border radius art, and even Hipster Dogs are all represented.</p>
 <p>In the same way that &quot;Information wants to be free&quot; or &quot;walruses want to play Saxophone<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq1xWuBIXDg ">*</a>&quot;, it&#39;s a Fundamental Law of Nature&#x2122; that Shiny wants to be forked, so <a href="https://github.com/operasoftware/shinydemos">we&#39;re opening up the code on Github</a>. Fork at leisure and send us pull requests if you spot some code that could be improved. All the code is open, although some of the assets aren&#39;t, so some images and media are hosted on media.shinydemos.com. Feel free to link to them there, or link to your own similar resources.</p>
 <p>What&#39;s that? You want to contribute a brand-new demo? Great! Soon we&#39;ll be publishing some detailed authoring guidelines, but for now the most important rules are</p>
 <ol>
 <li>make it shiny, and</li>
 <li>make it as cross-browser as possible.</li>
 </ol>
 <p>Head to <a href="https://github.com/operasoftware/shinydemos">https://github.com/operasoftware/shinydemos</a> and fork away. Heeeeere&#39;s Shiny!</p>
