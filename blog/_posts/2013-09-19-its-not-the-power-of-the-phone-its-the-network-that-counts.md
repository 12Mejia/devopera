<p>The death of the feature phone is widely reported and greatly exaggerated. &quot;Although we see a huge market &#39;hype&#39; around smartphones, the fact remains that the India mobile handset market is still dominated by shipments of feature phones. On the other hand, smartphone shipments are growing fast&quot; analyst <a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-02/telecom/38216822_1_handset-market-cybermedia-research-smartphone-shipments">Faisal Kawoosa said</a> in a Times of India article reporting that smartphones comprise just 7% of the overall Indian handset market.</p>

<p>But we find that owning smartphones doesn&#39;t alter one vital facet of web access in developing economies: the network. In countries like India, we see slow networks covering huge geographical areas and difficult terrain. That&#39;s why, even on high-powered devices, people still rely on data compression from browsers such as Opera Mini. Today <a href="http://business.opera.com/press/releases/mobile/2013-09-19_2">we announced</a> that over 100 Android devices shipping in India, Bangladesh and Nepal are pre-installed with Opera Mini.</p>

<p>But why? Isn&#39;t Opera Mini for low-powered phones that don&#39;t have an operating system capable of running a browser? Well, yes, that&#39;s the original rationale behind Opera Mini &#x2014; but we see that even with Android-powered devices, the bottleneck remains <em>the network</em>. Opera Mini can compress pages down to 10% of their original size. This makes browsing faster and consumes less bandwidth — absolutely vital for people on data plans that charge per megabyte.</p>

<p>We see a similar situation in the Asia Pacific region. <a href="http://business.opera.com/smw/2012/07/">In 2012 we wrote</a> &quot;From having 9% of Opera Mini users on smartphones in July 2011, the share of Opera Mini smartphone users in Asia Pacific countries
increased to 32% in July 2012&quot; and this continues to grow: <a href="http://business.opera.com/smw/2013/06/">in Indonesia</a>, the number of Opera Mini users on Android increased by 189% from May 2012 to May 2013.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get caught up in the hype that everyone has smartphones (or soon will), so you can be profligate with data and simply inject the DOM via script into empty &lt;body&gt; tags. For a large percentage of the world, it&#39;s not the power of the phone that&#39;s important, it&#39;s the network.</p>

<p>Good HTML content that you progressively enhance for JavaScript-capable browsers, tested on a slow connection, and images with proper alternate text (because many users turn off images in their browser) is still the way to ensure the web remains a world wide web.</p>
