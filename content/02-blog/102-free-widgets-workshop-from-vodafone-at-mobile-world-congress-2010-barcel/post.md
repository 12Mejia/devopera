<p>One of the most exciting technologies to arrive in the mobile arena lately is Widgets. If you don&#39;t know the name, think <em>applications</em> that live on your mobile device, that can look like native applications but are run using a browser rendering engine (with no browser chrome) and which are made using the Open Web technologies HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SVG.</p>
<p>On Monday, February 15, during Mobile World Congress 2010, Barcelona, Vodafone will host the 360 Developer Conference. This is a chance to learn how to make Widgets and how you can be rewarded for them by selling them through Vodafone&#39;s app store.</p>
