intro: 'The WebRTC standard allows supporting browsers to stream video and audio content directly from native devices such as a webcam. One rather exciting use case for WebRTC is head tracking — detecting the movement of your head (or other appendages) in relation to a webcam — which in turn allows us to create gesture-based controls. This article looks in depth at how head tracking can be implemented.'
