<p>We have updated the drop-down select in the <em>Scripts</em> panel in our latest cutting-edge and experimental builds. It now has a filter, to make it easier to find a script file, and an improved keyboard interaction.</p>
<img src="/blog/improved-script-select/script-select.png" alt="The improved script selection drop-down, showing the new filter functionality" /> 
<p>When you open the drop-down the filter gets focus automatically. <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> cursor keys will move the selection, and with <kbd>ENTER</kbd> you select the file to be displayed. When you type a part of the script file path, the amount of selectable options will get reduced accordingly. When you select a file with <kbd>ENTER</kbd>, the current search token gets stored, allowing you to quickly perform a previous search: when you open the drop-down, you can go through your previous searches with <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd>/<kbd>↓</kbd>. A summary of the available shortcuts:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> cursor keys: navigate the options</li>
<li><kbd>ENTER</kbd>: select the script</li>
<li><kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd>/<kbd>↓</kbd>: navigate the filter history</li>
<li><kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd>: open the drop-down, also from any other view.</li>
</ul>
<p>The build is available on experimental and cutting-edge. Try it out and tell us what you think!</p>
