<h2>Highlights</h2>

<p>We got our hands dirty in lots of really interesting projects this year.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Andreas</strong> led our team with grace and determination, and published some great material on <a href="http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2012/08/30/responsive-designs-opera-mobile-emulator/">responsive design</a>. He also organised <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/standardsnext-webgl-and-html5-based-games/">Standards-Next: WebGL and HTML5-based games</a> in Oslo, Norway.</li>
  <li><strong>Bruce</strong> wrote a fabulous series of articles for the <a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/baker/bruce-lawson/">Pastry Box project</a>, globe trotted around the place waving the standards flag and <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2012/the-perils-of-dressing-as-satan/">dressed up as Satan, again</a>. And since <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2011/notes-on-adaptive-images-yet-again/">proposing the &lt;picture&gt; element</a> last December  as a way to solve the <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/responsive-images-problem/">adaptive images problem</a>, a whole <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/">W3C community group</a> has grown up around it, leading to a <a href="http://picture.responsiveimages.org/">specification</a> guided by Marcos Cáceres and Mat Marquis. Whether or not it makes it into browsers, it&#39;s made everyone aware of the need.</li>
  <li><strong>Chris</strong> published his very own <a href="http://my.opera.com/chrismills/blog/2012/07/12/practical-css3-my-book-is-finally-published">CSS3 book</a> and joined the W3C as a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Recruitment/Fellows">W3C Fellow</a>, devoting a lot of his time to launching and organising <a href="http://www.webplatform.org">Webplatform.org</a>. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/conquestofsteel">His band</a> recorded their fourth album slated for release in early 2013, amidst rumours of his <a href="http://doeschrismillslikecoldplay.co.uk/">love of Coldplay</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Daniel</strong> used his gentlemanly charms to wow the fine folk of Japan, did a lot of work on <a href="http://dev.opera.com/addons/extensions/">extensions documentation</a>, and got heavily into web enabled TV research. Not just <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2012/12/11/tv-web-development-tips">TV web design &amp; development</a> but also communicating with TVs through a browser using the <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/network-service-discovery-api-support-in-opera/">Network Service Discovery API and UPnP</a>. So cool and full of potential!</li>  
    <li><strong>Karl</strong> kept pushing open standards in the French web communities, and set up some tools for the team, including a Python-based <a href="https://github.com/karlcow/websurvey">vendor prefix survey tool</a>. He also wrote a series of <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/tags/httpbasic">articles to raise awareness about HTTP</a>, even for UX and front-end developers.</li>
    <li><strong>Luz</strong> showed us her talents, publishing some fantastic articles and doing great talks on WebGL. See <a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP10895">Leaving Flatland: Getting Started with WebGL</a>!</li>
    <li><strong>Mike</strong> put his JavaScript and Portuguese skills to good use, doing some killer talks in both the US and South America. Highlights included <a href="http://miketaylr.com/pres/framsia/">JS on your TV</a> (actually, lots of useful stuff related to making web apps work on TV), and <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/sxsw-interactive/spmzy/">The state of browser dev tools</a>. He also kept us chuckling with his dry wit, and showed us how to do lots of difficult things with Git, JavaScript, and command-line scripts.</li>
    <li><strong>Patrick</strong> had an exciting new arrival to the family (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfHE8oxdHPw">welcome Jack!</a>), project managed <a href="http://www.opera.com/dragonfly/">Opera Dragonfly</a>, streamlined the look and feel of the <a href="http://www.opera.com/business/tv/emulator/">Opera TV Emulator</a>, and was a ray of sunshine all year round.</li>
    <li><strong>Shwetank</strong> weaved his magic around India, spreading his HTML5 and CSS3 wisdom across many conferences, including <a href="http://techshare.barrierbreak.com/agenda2012.php">Techshare</a> and <a href="http://delhitechforum.com/Events/HTML5DevCon.aspx">HTML5 Dev Con</a>, and wrote some great <a href="http://www.shinydemos.com">Shiny Demos</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Tiffany</strong> applied her writing and coding talents to creating some really cool <a href="http://www.shinydemos.com">Shiny Demos</a>, presentations, and articles, covering subjects such as <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/understanding-the-css-transforms-matrix/">CSS transform matrices</a>, <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/window-postmessage-messagechannel/">HTML5 web messaging</a> and <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/xhr2/">XHR2</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Vadim</strong> organised the fantastic <a href="http://webstandardsdays.ru/">Web Standards Days</a> conference in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Ekaterinburg, Kiev and Minsk; did some great talks in Russia, and lent us his fabulous design skills for many projects, including <a href="http://shinydemos.com/">Shiny Demos</a>!</li>
  <li><strong>Zi Bin</strong> managed the exciting new <a href="http://www.oupeng.com/">Oupeng project</a>: the new mobile browser that&#39;s taking the Chinese market by storm.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>Team newcomers Hallvord Steen, Kåre Byberg and Ola Kleiven helped the team to do our web compatibility work, and were generally just awesome fonts of knowledge. Together, the Core Compatibility team accomplished 196 commits to <a href="https://github.com/operasoftware/browserjs">browser.js</a>, representing <a href="https://github.com/operasoftware/browserjs/graphs/code-frequency">26,981 additions and 6,889 deletions</a>.</p>  

<p>Pat, Bruce, Andreas and Vadim also performed The Web Standards Hoedown at the Opera Xmas party in Oslo.</p>
