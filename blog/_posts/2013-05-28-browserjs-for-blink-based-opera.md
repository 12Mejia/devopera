Some may have noticed that the BrowserJS status page shows that it is indeed active in Opera 14 on Android and in the new Opera Next 15 for desktop. <br/><br/>Just today we put the initial files on GitHub. There isn&#39;t much in them yet and we hope it will not be neccessary to add much to them either, certainly less than we&#39;ve had in Opera Classic ;-)<br/><br/>In Opera 12 and earlier browser.js was quite powerful, being able to use all the UserJS events in Presto. So far these have not been carried over to Opera 14+ (all developers have been busy writing new UI etc.), meaning browser.js in Opera 14+ is less versatile than we&#39;re used to. Time will tell what will be needed to support.
