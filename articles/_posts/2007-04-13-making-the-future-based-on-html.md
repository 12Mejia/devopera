The W3C recently renewed its HTML activity. Opera joined the new [HTML Working Group][1] to help shape the future of the web and so can you. The HTML Working Group allows virtually everyone to participate. A set of simple steps on how to join is outlined on the WHATWG blog: [W3C restarts HTML effort][2]. If you have any questions or want to discuss HTML with members of the Working Group you can join the public IRC channel [#html-wg][3] on irc.w3.org (port 80 or 6665). As a starting point for the new Working Group Opera, together with Mozilla and Apple, [submitted][4] the WHATWG HTML5 proposal as initial input to base future work on. We hope that it proves to be a good starting point for the future of HTML.
