<p>
 Hi, guys! Happy New Year! We are pleased to start it with the Beta release of our WAC 1.0-supporting runtime for Android.
</p>
<p>
 This release is a &quot;follow up&quot;, including bugfixes, to our
 <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/labs-widgets-runtime-wac-1-0-supporting-alpha-for-android/">
  Alpha release
 </a>
 from 2010. We are aiming for 100% compliance with WAC 1.0 specs by the
 <a href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/">
  MWC
 </a>
 event in Barcelona, so there will be more bugfix releases before that :)
</p>
<p>
 Download the
 <a href="http://www.opera.com/download/get.pl?sub=++++&amp;amp;id=33391&amp;amp;location=318&amp;amp;nothanks=yes">
  Android build
 </a>.</p>
<p>
 This build has all WAC 1.0 APIs implemented and we started official 
  WAC 1.0 compliance 
 testing on the HTC Desire device (Android 2.2); preliminary results are available here:
 <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/widgets/imp-report/">
  compliance test results
 </a>
 . Please note that compliance testing is not finished yet, and significant volumes of tests haven&#39;t been executed, for instance, the digital signatures tests, which are currently being adjusted by WAC. We also fixed some serious bugs, particularly in camera, messaging and audio.</p>

<p>
 That said, this release completes the APIs integration work, and now we are primarily focusing on the stabilization and WAC 1.0 compliance program.
</p>
