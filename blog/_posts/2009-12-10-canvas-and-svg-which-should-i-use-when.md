As use of HTML5 is spreading, canvas and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) are being more widely used to create images within a web page. They are both supported by all major browsers (except Internet Explorer 8 and below) and are open alternatives to Flash for animation and graphic interaction. Why do we need two image-creation methods, however, and when should either be used?<br/><br/><strong>What is SVG?</strong><br/><ul class="bullets"><li>Has been a W3C standard for several years. With the arrival of HTML5 can be embedded into HTML pages.</li><li>XML-based language using tags to create image objects.</li><li>Resize as much as you want without losing quality.</li><li>Every element is available within the SVG DOM so you can attach JavaScript events to them.</li><li>Editing a single object or group of objects is easy.</li><li>Slows down with a large number of objects.</li><li>SVG is accessible - text is selectable just like regular text. <a href="http://www.iheni.com/just-how-accessible-is-svg/" target="_blank">Accessibility software needs to catch up</a>, however.</li></ul><br/><strong>What is canvas?</strong><br/><ul class="bullets"><li>At the time of writing, part of the HTML5 specification.</li><li>Pixel-based images using JavaScript to edit pixels.</li><li>Images become pixellated when enlarged.</li><li>Everything is drawn with pixels. To change anything in the image you have to edit the pixels.</li><li>Redrawing the pixels in the canvas area is fast.</li><li>Slows down with a large drawing area.</li><li>Canvas is not accessible (as of late 2009) - text is unreadable by e.g. screen readers and search engines.</li></ul><br/><strong>So what are canvas and SVG best suited for?</strong><br/>Because of its speed of manipulation, canvas is best when fast rendering and redrawing is needed, e.g. animations and games, such as in this example: <a href="http://www.benjoffe.com/code/demos/canvascape/" target="_blank">http://www.benjoffe.com/code/demos/canvascape/</a><br/><br/>SVG is better suited for large-scale rendering and interactivity, e.g. maps and user interfaces, such as in this slideshow demo: <a href="http://people.mozilla.com/~vladimir/demos/photos.svg" target="_blank">http://people.mozilla.com/~vladimir/demos/photos.svg</a><br/><br/>It should also be noted that it&#39;s not necessarily a choice of using one or the other. If required, there&#39;s a happy middle ground where SVG and canvas can be layered together to make the most of their respective strengths.<br/><br/>N.B. To work around Internet Explorer&#39;s lack of support, please look at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/" target="_blank">explorercanvas</a> for canvas capability and <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/" target="_blank">Raphael</a> for cross-browser vector graphics.<br/><br/><strong>Further reading:</strong><br/><ul class="bullets"><li><a href="http://svgopen.org/2009/papers/54-SVG_vs_Canvas_on_Trivial_Drawing_Application/" target="_blank">SVG vs. Canvas on Trivial Drawing Application</a></li><li><a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/svg-or-canvas-choosing-between-the-two/" target="_blank">SVG or Canvas?
