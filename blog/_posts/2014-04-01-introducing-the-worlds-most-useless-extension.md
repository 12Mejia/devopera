As enthusiastic fans of [this brilliant machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z86V_ICUCD4), we thought it was time for a tribute in the form of a browser extension. So, without further ado, we’re proud to introduce the **[world’s most useless extension](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/worlds-most-useless-extension/)** for your daily use and enjoyment.

If you’re interested in checking out the source, we’ve published all files [on GitHub](https://github.com/operasoftware/wmue).
