### What is Carakan?

Carakan is Opera’s new JavaScript engine. It’s still in development, but is already 2.5 times faster than our Opera 10 alpha engine (which itself is 30% faster on real websites than previous versions of Opera). Some aspects are between 5 and 50 times faster!

### Why are we developing it?

Because we can! Opera has always been about speed, security and a small memory footprint, so we’re constantly improving these aspects of the browser. Many of today’s web applications depend heavily on JavaScript, and we’re developing what will be **the fastest ECMAscript engine on the market**.

### When will Carakan be available?

Soon. We’ve chosen to talk about it now as we’re discussing it at the [Web  Directions North conference](http://north.webdirections.org/), but we’re still combing its hair and straightening its tie before we’re ready to let you see it.

### How does it work?

It’s a combination of brilliant coding and Scandinavian voodoo magic (“Snowdoo”). If you want more details about the brilliant coding, you can read all about register-based bytecode, automatic object classification and native code generation on the [Opera Core Concerns Blog](https://dev.opera.com/blog/carakan/). We’re sworn to secrecy about the Snowdoo. By a <del>Yeti</del> <ins>troll</ins>.

### What does “Carakan” mean?

We thought about naming it “Unicorn-badger”, “StackDonkey” or “Shouting Otter”. But, we’ve chosen the name “Carakan”" (pronounced “Jarakan”), which is the [original alphabet from the Indonesian island of Java](http://www.omniglot.com/writing/javanese.htm).

In other words, it’s the purest Java Script. When you try it, you’ll agree.
