intro: 'We have practised feature detection to allow us to provide appropriate code to browsers with differing levels of standards support for a while now, but we’ve always needed 3rd party libraries to handle it. But not for much longer: the CSS3 Conditional Rules Module Level 3 provides the `@supports` at-rule and associated JavaScript API, providing a native mechanism for doing CSS feature detection. In this article we’ll give you the lowdown on how this rule works, looking at a real example in the process.'
