We’ve been quiet lately, mostly working on internal QA for upcoming features and rewrites. But with 11.60 coming we need a Browser.js for it and we have a couple of small patches for you as well. Enjoy.

## Added patches

- PATCH-533, Add jQuery to Amazon At A Glance page. Just another small piece of the puzzle.
- PATCH-532, GDocs: avoid jumping to top when scrolling document list. Actually a regression in Ragnarök, updating ARIA attributes on elements can reset the scroll position. This made it impossible to scroll do the bottom of a long document list in Google Docs with the new layout.
- PATCH-529, Fix SiteCatalyst H.9 code on Nissan/Infiniti USA. They use a very old SiteCatalyst version that has known document.write problems.
