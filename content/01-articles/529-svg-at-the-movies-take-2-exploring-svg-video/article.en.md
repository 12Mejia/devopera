The triumvirate is now complete - we released a Windows version of our great new experimental Opera Kestrel HTML5 video/3D Canvas/SVG video build a couple of weeks ago along with an article about HTML5 video. Then Tim Johannson wrote an article about using the 3D canvas, which you&#39;ll find below. Now for the hatrick, Erik Dahlstr√∂m has written an article explaining how to use SVG Video.
